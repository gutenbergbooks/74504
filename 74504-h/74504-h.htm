<small>LUCKY MEETS JOHN DEAN</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“WATCH my papers, will you please,
Mister?” Scarcely waiting for a
reply, the bright eyed little newsboy left his
stand and darted across the street, where he
confronted a ragamuffin, nearly a head taller
than himself.</p>

<p>“You have to play fair,” he began hotly,
“or you can’t sell papers in this block.”
Then calling to a youngster who looked little
more than a baby, and who was standing
several yards away where the bigger boy
had chased him, he said:</p>

<p>“Come back here, Billy! You have as
much right to this corner as Spot. And
don’t you forget that, you Spot,” he flung
back over his shoulder as he recrossed the
street.</p>

<p>The big stranger who had been left in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
charge of the papers, watched the proceedings
with considerable amusement.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble, sonny?” he asked,
and beneath the stern lines of his face lurked
a smile that invited confidence.</p>

<p>The boy recognized him as a rancher, for
many of his type came to this great packing
center, bringing their herds from the big
ranches of the West. You could easily tell
them by their breezy manners and friendly
ways.</p>

<p>“Oh, that Spot chases every little feller
off the block, so there won’t be any com—com—”</p>

<p>“Competition?” the ranchman suggested.</p>

<p>“That’s it—competition. Spot’s nothing
but a bully. He won’t pick on anyone his
size.”</p>

<p>“And you take it upon yourself to ‘beard
the lion in his den’ and act as champion?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know anything about that,” replied
the boy, flushing, “but how are all
these little fellows going to get a start in
business unless somebody takes their part?”</p>

<p>The cattleman eyed the boy keenly. He
was quite different from the other little
“newsies” shouting hoarsely the startling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
news of their papers’ headlines. He appeared
underfed, as did many of the children
of the slums crowding the streets; his
clothes were patched and repatched, but
they were clean. His face, too, was clean,
and his hair, somewhat ragged and uncut,
showed the industrious use of comb and
brush. He was a lad of about twelve.</p>

<p>John Dean—for that was the stranger’s
name—looked down the narrow, dirty, ill-smelling
street, with its crowds of surging
humanity, down the dingy rows of tenement
houses with their crying children and
their scolding mothers standing in the doorways.
He saw the heavy trucks pounding
over the brick pavements, and the rattling
wagons, and he thought of the calm that
rested over his own boundless country.
What a difference there was between the
fetid air that rose from this cavernous street
and the invigorating breeze that swept
across his prairie lands out West! What a
difference there was between his stalwart,
robust cowboys and the wan-faced, hollow-chested
men he saw about him!</p>

<p>The boy before him, according to all the
rules of the game should have been another
victim of the environment in which he lived.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
Dean found himself liking the lad, his actions,
and especially his championship of the
weak. Was there much of such material in
this crowded, unwholesome place, he wondered,
as he continued on his way.</p>

<p>The business that had called Mr. Dean to
Chicago was completed and yet he was compelled
to wait four days more because he
had promised to meet a certain man, who
would not arrive in Chicago until then.
Time would hang heavily on his hands, he
thought. His thoughts traveled back to the
newsboy.</p>

<p>There came to him a sudden impulse; he
decided to follow it and so he retraced his
steps to where the boy was stationed.</p>

<p>“Back again, mister?” The boy smiled
in greeting as if to an old friend. But it
could be no more than a second’s greeting,
for customers kept him busy.</p>

<p>“What’s your name, sonny?” the man
asked, when the opportunity offered.</p>

<p>“Ted—Ted Marsh,” answered the boy.</p>

<p>“Will you soon be through?” Dean inquired.
“I’ll tell you why I ask. I should
like you to take me about the city. I know
something about it, but there are lots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
places I want to see which you can show
me. I will pay you for your time, of
course.”</p>

<p>The boy thought for a minute. He turned
and looked squarely at the man. Dean liked
that—he met his eye.</p>

<p>“You will have to wait until I finish my
papers,” the boy said. “Then I will have
to run home and let my mother know. Otherwise
she would worry. But I’ll tell you
what, sir”—a new idea had come to him—“I
can take you down to the Settlement; you
can see that while I finish up.”</p>

<p>“That’s all right, lad. I’ll watch awhile
and see you doing business.”</p>

<p>This promised to be quite interesting,
John Dean decided, with a sudden zest. He
looked forward to the evening before him.
He watched the boy, his quickness and his
method, and he noted that Ted was the least
bit quicker than the other boys and that he
seemed to enjoy the competition and the
struggle of selling papers. Dean decided it
was a hard game. The boy’s stock of papers
was rapidly diminishing.</p>

<p>“I can take you over now, Mr.——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>“Dean,” answered the owner of that
name, smiling.</p>

<p>“Then I can return and finish up, get
home and be back, all in about an hour. Will
that be all right?”</p>

<p>“It will—fine,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The two walked down to the Settlement.
On the way Ted explained how fine a place
it was, just what it did, the clubs in it, and
the gymnasium classes. He told the man,
quite proudly, that he was a Scout.</p>

<p>“My! I wish you could meet Miss Wells,”
the boy added.</p>

<p>The man started. He turned eagerly at
the name. He was about to ask a question—stopped—changed
his mind and allowed
the boy to continue telling of the many fine
points of the place to which he was being
taken. The boy did so with tremendous
pride.</p>

<p>“I suppose you go to the Settlement
often?” he remarked.</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the reply. “It’s better than
idling about on the corners. More fun, too,”
he added.</p>

<p>The man’s interest grew. He asked many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
questions, all of which the boy answered as
best he could.</p>

<p>Miss White, one of the workers, came to the
door.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ted,” she greeted him pleasantly.
She also smiled a welcome to the man.</p>

<p>“This is Mr. Dean, a friend of mine,” said
Ted. “Is Miss Wells in, Miss White?”</p>

<p>“No, she will not be in until late in the
evening. Can I do anything?”</p>

<p>The boy explained and added that he
wanted Mr. Dean to know the place. Miss
White promised to show it to him, while Ted
hurried back to finish the sale of his papers
before going home.</p>

<p>To Miss White, who was very friendly
and likable, Dean explained his impulse and
his impressions, his desire to know more of
the boy. Miss White was fully acquainted
with the facts, she knew Ted quite well and
also knew his family.</p>

<p>The man listened closely while she told
the boy’s history.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER II<br>

<small>MISS WHITE’S STORY</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE story, as Miss White told it, was not
unusual in that part of the city, but to
John Dean there was every element of newness
in it.</p>

<p>He listened without interruption as the
story unfolded itself.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh, Ted’s mother, had had a hard
time of it. Bill Marsh had married her
eighteen years ago. Bill was a good mechanic,
but after about six years of happiness
things began to go wrong. He lost his
position and at that time work was not easy
to get. Day after day he had searched for
something to do. Discouraged, he had taken
to drink. Then there was a day when Bill
did not return. In all these years Mrs.
Marsh had never heard of him. She felt
he was dead, yet even that she did not know.</p>

<p>It was a hard struggle afterward. Sewing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
and washing, early and late, and many a day
she went hungry, so that the two children
could eat. The mother often spoke of how
Ted, when eight years old, had gone out one
afternoon and had not returned until seven
o’clock. Without a word he had put fifteen
cents on the table and then had turned to
eat. He showed by the way he ate how hungry
he was. After the meal was over, he
explained how he had made up his mind to
support the family, and so he had bought
some papers; the fifteen cents was profit.
His capital, also some extra pennies, was
intact, so that he could buy more papers.</p>

<p>“I’m going to support this family,” Ted
had said, “I’m the man and it’s up to me.”</p>

<p>That was the beginning of Ted as a newsboy.
He was very proud of his newsboy
badge, and gradually, as he grew older, his
help was quite a big share of the family expense,
it counted against the family burden.</p>

<p>When Ted was almost eleven, he had
joined the Settlement. Miss Wells, who
grew to know the boy, his fine qualities, his
independence and manliness had had a wonderful
influence upon him. But there was
also in Ted that mischievous streak, that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
spirit of fun, and even of trouble-making
that every healthy, normal boy has.</p>

<p>It was through one of these mischievous
pranks that Miss Wells had first met Ted.
One day the boys had shut themselves in a
room, six or seven of them, and bolted the
door. When Mr. Jones, who was the Settlement
Boys’ Worker, had asked them to come
out, none of them wanted to show the white
feather, and so they had not answered him,
but had continued to stay in there. Mr.
Jones locked the door with a key and left
them, expecting that very soon they would
call out, send an S. O. S., and beg to be let
out. But there was no call, and after a half
hour or so he had gone back to the door. It
was very quiet within, unusually so. He
managed to open the door after quite a lot
of work. The room was empty.</p>

<p>There was only one other way out,
through the window. It was a sheer drop of
twenty or more feet, so to escape from there
seemed out of the question. The last boy
dropping out of the window could not, of
course, stop to close it, and the fact remained
that the window was closed.</p>

<p>Could they have come out through the
door? He was sure they had not done so,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
as he had been very near the room all of the
time. Then, too, it was hardly likely that
any of the boys would have had a key to fit
the rather unusual lock.</p>

<p>Cautious was Mr. Jones. These observations
had to be made without creating any
suspicion in any of the other watching, grinning
boys all about. He did not wish them
to know that things were not as they should
be and that he was at sea as to how they had
made their escape. Pretty soon the boys
who had been in that room, one after another,
came into the building. They were
all so innocent looking, butter would not
have melted in the mouths of any of them.
They never did tell him, but they did tell
Miss Wells and the rest of the workers, how
Ted would not let them open the door and
had refused to let them call Mr. Jones when
the door had been locked a half hour. How
he had called for help to some older boys
who had been passing in the street below.
They were not members of the Settlement
and were ready for any mischief. They
had obtained a ladder that Ted told them
was lying on the ground near a close-by
fence. He had been the last to leave on that
ladder, which almost touched the window-sill,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
and he had carefully closed the window
after him. He warned them not to tell Mr.
Jones, but it was too good a joke not to tell
others.</p>

<p>It was after this that Miss Wells had
spoken to Ted and had realized how much
fineness there was in the boy, in spite of his
mischievous, fun-loving disposition. There
were other times Ted had been caught in
mischief, but there never had been any suspicion
of meanness in any of the escapades.
He was honest, you felt that, and he looked
at you fearlessly, truthfully. He learned to
love Miss Wells; she could do things with
him, when others could not. She could make
him see what was right and what was wrong,
what was fair and what was not fair. She
made him see ahead, too; to have ambitions
and a desire to be something worth while.
He had a good head and he often used it,
too.</p>

<p>A great opportunity came to Ted and to
the other boys. A scout master came to the
Settlement and Ted, now over 12, became a
Scout. He did many extra little things so
that he could earn the necessary money for
the suit and the other expenses, such as
initiation and dues. The sale of the Posts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>
helped him and he eagerly watched the announcements
of the many awards of the
Saturday Evening Post. While not often
successful in prize-winning, the help he received
from his sales was invaluable. He
soon passed his tenderfoot test and earnestly
and successfully tried to understand
woodcraft and all the other things a Scout
should know. He was loyal to his oath. It
had to be a very good deed each day for him
to be satisfied. Being a good Scout was a
great ambition, so he found.</p>

<p>Much trouble he had had with the boys of
the neighborhood. Once he had seen three
or four of them laughing at and poking a
tiny mongrel to whose tail they had tied a
tin can almost as big as the pup itself. There
was a good deed to do, and so he sprang at
the laughing, jeering urchins, who gave way
for but a moment and then proceeded to
pound him. It was a hard fight and they
were succeeding fairly well when two of the
Settlement boys came along and the other
youngsters scampered.</p>

<p>The poor pup, after Ted had untied the
string, licked his shoes, whining eagerly,
and so, with a sudden impulse, the boy had
picked up the pup and brought him home.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
Mrs. Marsh had not been specially pleased,
but she let Ted have his way. The dog
stayed.</p>

<p>Between school and the Settlement Ted
was receiving an education equal to that of
any one. Only the summer before Miss
Wells had spoken to Mrs. Marsh and then
both of them had insisted that Ted was to
go to the Settlement Camp for two weeks.</p>

<p>“I can’t go,” answered Ted. There was
regret in his voice. To go seemed the most
wonderful thing in the world. “Who’s going
to tend to my papers and my Posts?
I’m not going to lose my customers; can’t
afford to build up a new business.” The
voice sounded final.</p>

<p>“You can get some of the other boys to do
it for the two weeks,” Miss Wells replied.
“I’m sure Tom and Arthur would do it for
you and then, when they go, you can help
them.”</p>

<p>That plan suited Tom and Arthur just
as much as it did Ted. So he went to camp
for two weeks. I do not have to tell any of
the boys who read this of the fun he had.
Tramping, going to the village, swimming,
rowing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>The bugle awakened them at six-thirty.
Down to the lake for a swim and setting-up
exercises. Or, if you happened to be on the
Cook, Waiters’ or Mess Tent Committee, you
had to arise at five-thirty to prepare breakfast.
At seven you were so hungry you
could eat shoeleather. At seven-fifteen, you
went to it.</p>

<p>Then your work, whatever committee you
were on, Grounds, Tent, Water, such as it
was, had to be done. At ten-thirty, inspection,
then a tramp or another swim, perhaps
rowing or reading, if you were lazy. Dinner,
for which you were quite ready, or, perhaps,
this was the day for a long “hike” and you
were off somewhere, with lunch.</p>

<p>There usually was a baseball game in the
afternoon. Some of the boys, Ted too, caddied
for a neighboring golf club several
afternoons of the week. The money thus
earned paid for Ted’s stay at camp.</p>

<p>At night there was a campfire and songs.
Ted had a wonderful time, but the two
weeks were up very, very soon. Without a
useless regret, he went back to his papers
and his daily job.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh’s lot became a little easier.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
Thanks to her daughter Helen’s wages and
Ted’s earnings, things had been bettered.</p>

<p>Miss White went on to explain about
Helen. She was sixteen years old, for more
than a year she had been one of the many
salesgirls in one of the big department stores
of Chicago. She was a bright girl, always
willing, and so attentive that the miserable
wage with which she had started had been
doubled in the one year. It was still pitifully
small notwithstanding.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marsh has often said, ‘I am rich in
my children, if in nothing else’,” she quoted.</p>

<p>“She certainly is,” John Dean answered
heartily.</p>

<p>There were more things Miss White told
John Dean. As he listened he made up his
mind to do what he could, for here was a
youngster who had the makings of a fine
man. Dean felt that this was a great opportunity
for him.</p>

<p>When Ted came in soon after he found
his two friends going through the Settlement
and Miss White explaining to an interested
and earnest listener the things the
Settlement was doing, just how it was making
good future citizens.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>As Mr. Dean turned to leave, he asked
Miss White for pen and ink and left a check
for a large amount with her.</p>

<p>“Just a little to help in the work,” he remarked.
And because he was a modest and
a very bashful man, he blushed. Ted and he
hurried out.</p>

<small>THE FIRE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“TED,” Dean turned to the boy, “I
should like to go through that part of
the city in which you live. I want to see the
streets around there and what is on them.”</p>

<p>Ted wondered why anyone should want to
see that part if they did not have to do it.
But he did not question; after all, it was for
his friend to say what to do and where to go.</p>

<p>So they walked that way. After fifteen
minutes or so, Ted turned to Dean and said:</p>

<p>“This is my street.”</p>

<p>They walked a few more blocks and Ted
added, “I live a little way further up.” The
man continued observing and made no comment.
He was thinking—thinking hard.
He turned to the boy and was about to
speak.</p>

<p>“Ted, how long—”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>Even as he spoke came the distant, insistent
clang of bells, the blare and blast of
many whistles, shrieking their warnings. It
seemed but a second later when a belching
fire-engine, followed by a stream of trucks,
dashed perilously through the crowded
street, while in their wake came a mob of
hurrying people pouring from the dark
doorways of the tenements. From a side
street came a police patrol.</p>

<p>The boy climbed to the top of a stand and
from that vantage point he saw a cloud of
smoke issuing from a tenement building a
couple of blocks away. As he looked a
tongue of fire shot from one of its windows
and licked its way up the side of the building.</p>

<p>“That’s down near where I live,” John
Dean heard the boy say, as he leaped down
from the box and started on a run. The
rancher hastened after him, threading his
way through the crowd. Back of them came
another newsboy.</p>

<p>“Your house is burning up, Ted,” he
shouted, but Ted had already seen the disaster
that had come upon his home. It was
a poor one indeed, but a home, nevertheless,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
that sheltered his mother. Ted wondered
where she was. He knew that Helen at least
was not there.</p>

<p>The cattleman had never seen a city fire.
Before they arrived at the burning building,
the police had driven back the fighting
crowds and had drawn ropes across the
street, past which no one dared go. Helmeted
firemen rushed through doorways,
drawing long lines of hose, while now and
then, through the smoke and fire pouring
from the windows, heroic men could be
seen clinging to the face of the dingy building,
pushing upward from ledge to ledge
with their line of ladders.</p>

<p>Some of the men entered through the
broken windows, only to appear again suffocated
and choking from the smoke and
flames, then returning to risk life and limb
for those who might still be in the house,
cut off from escape.</p>

<p>John Dean saw little of this, however.
Back and forth he tramped through the
crowds, never losing sight of his little newsboy
friend. Ted’s face was white and
tense.</p>

<p>“Has anybody seen Mrs. Marsh? Anybody<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
seen mother?” he inquired on every
hand, and the man took up the question,
“Has anyone seen Mrs. Marsh?” But no
one had.</p>

<p>They pressed their way to the rope,
searching the faces of the long line of
spectators.</p>

<p>“Move back there!” commanded the officer,
and pushed the crowd from the straining
rope. Ted scarcely heard the warning.
He was standing gazing at a certain curling
line of flame eating its way up the
casement of a fourth floor window, and as
the heated pane cracked and fell shattered
to the pavement below, a sob broke from
his lips. An instant later he darted beneath
the rope, past the officer and toward the
burning building.</p>

<p>“Stop that boy!” shouted the officer.
“The little fool! Heaven help him get out of
there,” for Ted had slipped past the clutching
hands of the firemen and had entered
the burning building.</p>

<p>People who had seen the boy rush in,
shuddered with apprehension. A second
officer stood threatening big John Dean,
forcing him back into the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>“You go after that kid and I’ll arrest
you,” he said, flourishing his club. “His
mother isn’t in there, anyhow. The firemen
will take care of the boy.”</p>

<p>The restless, surging crowd, after a time,
became hushed and silent. Only the hissing
engines and the captain’s orders could
be heard above the crackling flames, except
as shattering glass and falling brick
told how surely the fire was gaining headway.</p>

<p>As moment followed moment and Ted
failed to appear, the officer took the
anxious cattleman by the arm.</p>

<p>“Stay where you are,” he admonished.
“You couldn’t get the boy if you went in.
I have a youngster of my own,” he added.
Then excitedly they pointed to an upper
window. “They’ve got him,” he cried, and
all through the crowd went a ripple of expectancy.</p>

<p>But the form that was slung across the
fireman’s shoulder, as he climbed through
the window onto the ladder, was not that
of the little newsboy. It was the limp body
of a brother fireman rescued from the
smoke, the last of the firemen who had followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
Ted into the seething tenement. A
waiting ambulance hurried the unconscious
man to a hospital.</p>

<p>Presently a warning cry from the chief
caused the firemen to retreat hastily, withdrawing
their lines of hose, as their attention
was called to a long, widening crack
zigzagging its way across the face of the
building.</p>

<p>“The wall is going,” the officer told
Dean, and the words struck a chill into the
heart of the big Westerner. He turned his
back. For what seemed to him hours he
waited for the impending crash that meant
the destruction of his heroic little friend.
Suddenly a resounding cheer broke from
the crowd. Dean turned and saw, high
upon the edge of the building, battling his
way along through the smoke, appearing
for an instant and then lost to sight, Ted’s
figure creeping along the cornice. One arm
was held tightly to his bosom.</p>

<p>“Easy, lad, easy,” the chief called up
encouragingly through his megaphone to
the boy. A dozen firemen had seized a
blanket and stood with it outspread, waiting
for Ted to jump. “Are you afraid?”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
the chief shouted, and he glanced anxiously
at the widening crack. “All right, boy.
One—two—” Ted straightened up slowly.
A cloud of smoke enveloped him, but
through it, five stories above, the crowd
saw his little form hurl itself through the
air and drop into the blanket below. A
crashing wall drowned their cheers.</p>

<p>All up and down the rope barrier the
officers were forcing back the excited spectators,
but out of the crowd came a little
pale-faced, anxious woman. She hastened
to the side of the doctor, who bent over Ted
as he lay in the blanket. John Dean hurried
after her unmolested, and as he saw what
Ted had held so tightly to his breast, he uttered
an exclamation.</p>

<p>“By George! Now what do you think of
that!” he cried, for there, whining and
nosing about the boy’s feet stood a weak-limbed,
helpless little puppy. The doctor
was making a hasty examination.</p>

<p>“No, Mrs. Marsh,” he repeated again and
again, “your boy is not dead. He will
come around soon; pretty much shaken up.
No bones broken. Yes, of course he is
breathing. Hospital? Yes, but don’t you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
worry about the expense; arrangements
can be made.”</p>

<p>“Doctor, see that he has the best there is;
I will foot the bills, for Ted is a friend of
mine,” Dean broke in impulsively.</p>

<p>A waiting ambulance, which the doctor
beckoned, drew up and cut off any further
conversation. As they placed Ted on
the stretcher, John Dean hailed a taxi and
helped Mrs. Marsh in. “Follow that ambulance,”
he directed, as he stepped in beside
the little mother.</p>

<p>A few moments later they were seated in
the waiting room of the immaculate hospital.
Mrs. Marsh sat opposite the doorway
watching anxiously each trim, white-capped
nurse as she sped noiselessly down
the hall, and feeling strangely out of place
in the fine surroundings, so different from
the sordid tenement she had called home.</p>

<p>“I hope my daughter has not heard of this
as yet. She would be so worried. I wish I
could get a message to her, so that she will
know things are not so bad,” said Mrs.
Marsh anxiously.</p>

<p>“If you will give me the address I will
attend to that,” said Dean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>Mrs. Marsh gave him the address. He
summoned a messenger boy and wrote a reassuring
message to the girl and added that
she should come to the hospital when she
could.</p>

<p>“You are all so good,” the woman said,
gratefully. “I do not know what I would
have done without you, sir, and I do not
know how I can ever thank you.”</p>

<p>“That will be all right, Mrs. Marsh,” the
man answered. “I know Ted; he and I are
friends.”</p>

<p>Very briefly, he explained his acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marsh,” he added quietly, “you
need not worry because of the fact that Ted
is in the hospital. Do you know what you
are going to do? No? Well, I am going to
tell you. There is good stuff in that boy of
yours, Mrs. Marsh, and I feel sure that he
won’t always be a newsboy. I am going to
loan to you, through him, one hundred dollars.
No, I won’t listen to any objections.
I tell you it is only a loan. And out of that
hundred dollars you can buy such things as
you must have at once.”</p>

<p>With that he removed the broad leather<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
belt he wore and from it drew an astounding
roll of bills of large denomination. He
thrust five of them into Mrs. Marsh’s
hands with an air of finality that gave her
no reason to refuse.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER IV<br>

<small>JOHN DEAN FINDS A “FRIEND”</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE next half hour was an anxious one.
Then Helen appeared. Dean liked her
looks. Things were explained to her. She
did not become hysterical, but gave her attention
and thoughts to the comfort of her
mother.</p>

<p>“There is nothing to worry over, mother.
Ted will soon be well and as for the things
that are burned, at least we are insured.
Think of the many people who could not
afford insurance, they are in a much worse
plight than we are.” She certainly was a
brave soul, Dean thought.</p>

<p>Dr. Herrick came in a little later. He
smiled reassuringly. Turning to Mrs. Marsh
he said:</p>

<p>“There is a little boy in Room 30 that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
wants to see his mother. Second door, main
hall, to the right. Miss Wells just came.
She has a very busy night before her, don’t
you think, Mrs. Marsh?”</p>

<p>“Bless her kind heart! That is just like
her,” Mrs. Marsh exclaimed fervently.
“She is an angel, Mr. Dean. A friend of
every poor child and mother in the district.
She is a real lady, too; not like the kind of
folks that live on our street, you know—but
you have no idea the good she does nor the
comfort she gives.”</p>

<p>The doctor had motioned the cattleman
to go with Mrs. Marsh and Helen, and as
they entered Room 30, Mrs. Marsh ran
quickly to the side of the small white bed
where the brave little patient lay. For an
instant Ted’s eyes fluttered open, and then
shut. A look of contentment passed over
his pain-drawn face.</p>

<p>Facing the window, speaking in a low,
soft voice to the nurse, Dean noticed the
young woman Dr. Herrick said would be
there. “The settlement worker,” he said to
himself. Then, as the girl turned in the
full light of the window, a gasp of astonishment
escaped him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>“Amy Wells! So you are the Miss Wells?
Oh, Amy! Amy! I might have known—”
but what John Dean might have known was
not said just then, for the young woman,
equally as surprised as he, held up a warning
finger and quickly led him out into the
broad hall.</p>

<p>Now what was said between them matters
but little, but the poor people who
lived on Ted’s street afterwards told how
a fabulously rich cattleman spent half the
night helping Miss Wells find homes for all
those who were made homeless by the fire
that destroyed the big tenement house.
They exaggerated and repeated the stories
so often that had big-hearted John Dean
heard but half of them, he would have
reddened with embarrassment. Nevertheless,
it was true that many of the poor
families had their empty pocket books replenished
that night by the generous
stranger.</p>

<p>A week later, more news spread up and
down the street, to the effect that Miss
Wells, too, had once lived in the West,
where she and John Dean had been the
very, very best of friends, but somehow
they became not-friends, and now they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>
were reconciled, and Miss Wells was going
to leave them all and go back with John
Dean to a wonderful new home. But the
news brought much unhappiness to the
mothers on that street, and many a little
group stood in the hot, dirty stairways and
told how the pretty settlement worker,
whom they all loved, had saved their babies
when they were expected to die, and had
watched over their sick children night after
night when the heated city gave no relief
to the fever patients.</p>

<p>And Ted Marsh, to whom the news had
slipped in, was unhappiest of all.</p>

<p>“Aren’t we ever going to see Mister
Dean and Miss Wells any more after they
leave, mother?” Ted asked the seventh
afternoon as he lay in the hospital. Mrs.
Marsh did not speak for a minute. Finally,
evading his question, she answered:</p>

<p>“They will be here to see you this afternoon.”
And then, as she heard footsteps
in the hall, “There they are now.”</p>

<p>But the visitor proved to be Dr. Herrick.
Walking over to where Ted was sitting up
in bed, he began to examine him thoroughly,
after which he stood back and surveyed
him with a good-natured smile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>“Well, lad, you have pulled through
pretty well. Hair a little singed, but that
will grow out—hands healing nicely, and
lungs in good shape. I tell you, boy, you
are fortunate. A few weeks out in the
country would be all that could be asked
to make you sound as a bell.”</p>

<p>“Is that all that is required, Doctor?”
asked Mr. Dean, for he and Miss Wells had
stepped into the room, just in time to hear
the last sentence. “Don’t you think I owe
Ted a few weeks in the country for finding
Miss Wells for me again, when I hadn’t
seen or heard from her for five years? Ted,
you are a regular little mascot.”</p>

<p>At the word “mascot” a sudden idea
seized John Dean. Drawing Amy Wells
aside, he began speaking rapidly in a low
voice. What he had to say evidently
pleased her very much, but a look of doubt
caused her to knit her pretty eyebrows.
Mr. Dean, too, looked more sober, but he
turned and came directly to Mrs. Marsh.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marsh,” he began without preliminaries,
“Ted, here, must go west with
Amy and me. He has the kind of stuff in
him that goes to make a man, and we
can’t get too much stock of that sort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
out in our part of the country. You owe
it to him—we all owe it to him—to get
him out of the life he must face if he goes
back to the street and his news-stand. He
needs opportunity, and a chance to live
in a place where he can fill both lungs with
clean, fresh, health-giving air. He can’t get
it in the city; he can on the ranch, and I’ll
see to it that he gets the best education that
money can obtain. Ted is our mascot. Amy
and I can’t leave him here.”</p>

<p>Ted listened, open-mouthed, to all that
was said that afternoon, for John Dean’s
speech brought forth a long and earnest
discussion in Room 30. Little Mrs. Marsh’s
protests became fainter and fainter, until
finally she reluctantly gave her consent,
realizing it was a great opportunity for Ted.</p>

<p>It was Helen who had really convinced
Mrs. Marsh when she said: “We must let
Ted have his chance, mother. We must not
be selfish.”</p>

<p>A few days later found Ted Marsh standing,
bright eyed, on the observation platform
of a Pullman, watching the country
roll behind him.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER V<br>

<small>NEWS FOR THE DOUBLE X</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“SAY, boys, the boss is coming tomorrow.”
Smiles, the speaker, proved
the correctness of his nickname, for there
was a broad grin on his countenance as he
gave the message.</p>

<p>Fourteen men were sitting about a table.
Busily, noisily too, they were clearing away
the food. There was no pretense as to the
finer points of table etiquette, the food came
and it went; speed was the object. They
were hungry men.</p>

<p>“How do you know he’s coming?” asked
Pete.</p>

<p>“Jim Wilson passed by and left the message.
Telegram. What’s more, here is the
real news. He is not coming alone, he’s
married.” And Smiles—Arthur Holden, at
such times when his dignity and his position
as foreman of the Double X required it—grinned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
with the full appreciation of the
sensation his words caused.</p>

<p>“Married?” echoed Pete, who seemed to
be the only one whose tongue did not seem
paralyzed. “To whom?”</p>

<p>“Well, you see, it’s like this.” The first
speaker drawled out the words. “I hate to
confess it, but Jack neither asked me nor
told me the particulars. I shall have to
chide him, I fear.”</p>

<p>“I suppose he should have asked your
permission,” Pete agreed.</p>

<p>“What I want to know is, would you have
given it?” This, from another of the men,
Al Graham.</p>

<p>“Yes, Smiles, with your experience, how
would you have decided?”</p>

<p>Smiles was notoriously bashful and could
never be found when any women folks were
about.</p>

<p>“I guess Smiles’ experience in the last
twenty years has been seeing the Wells over
beyond. If he saw them first he’d vanish,
pronto.” The last speaker was older than
the rest, quiet appearing, a little sad. They
knew him as Pop. He had given his name as
Dick Smith, when he first came, many years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
ago. The ethics of the West is never to ask
questions of a man’s past. It judges a man
by his present. The speaker continued:
“But I tell you fellows, being married is too
good for most of us It’s a wonderful thing,
if you can make a go of it, if you can support
the proposition.”</p>

<p>The talk continued about the surprise and
an eager desire to see the couple was expressed
by many of the men. There was a
general feeling of pleasure, also, at Dean’s
coming home. These men were all good
friends of John Dean. But, mixed with it
all, curiously, was that tone of sadness and
regret, as if the subject of the conversation
had gone from them. They all seemed to
feel that his being married placed them beyond
his pale.</p>

<p>“Do you know, some day I expect Jack
Dean to get very tired of this neck of the
woods and pull up his stakes. He will be
one more of the many who drift to the big
town and think that that is the life. I wonder
how Mrs. Dean—sounds funny, doesn’t
it?—” continued Al Graham, “is going to
stand it? It’s hard for anyone who doesn’t
like it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>“Well,” said Pete, “that’s just it, Al.
Jack likes it as much as any of us. He can’t
stay away from it. It calls him, same as it
does you and me. But as to Mrs. Dean, I’m
doing some wondering myself.”</p>

<p>“Seems to me,” Red Mack spoke for the
first time, “you folks had better not worry
too much over it. I shouldn’t be a bit surprised
if they had thought of that matter a
little bit themselves. I gather they must
have, since it’s their particular business.”</p>

<p>Someone threw a boot at the speaker.
“You sarcastic creature,” said Pete, lovingly.
“But, anyway, I hope Mrs. Dean will
like us.”</p>

<p>Pipes were lighted now, the men were
comfortably lolling about; it was a period
of rest and calm. The light of day held a
touch of the gathering twilight—it seemed
as if some master painter was tingeing his
colors, so bringing a darker shade. Some
of the men drifted away, lazily bound for
some little task or pleasure. Some of them
remained ready for anything that might
come.</p>

<p>It was not always so quiet at this hour.
Possibly the news that they had heard had a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>
sobering effect. Then, too, most of the men
were off on a roundup and the few that were
left felt lonesome.</p>

<p>“I feel,” said Pete, “that things are becoming
so quiet around here we’ll die of
ennui.” Pete delighted in springing a new
word upon the crowd and he did it often to
show his knowledge. The boys understood
the spirit of fun in which it was done and
that it was not to show superiority. He
continued:</p>

<p>“Time was, when the Indians would give
us some excitement. Now Lo, the poor Indian,
is so wealthy and has waxed so fat,
thanks to a paternal government, he won’t
fight. The sheep-men seem to have found
their place, though if it were I who decided
on the place they deserve, you know where
I’d be sending them. As it is, you never
can tell when they will make trouble.
Here’s hoping it’s soon.”</p>

<p>“Well, there’s McGowan,” Pop said. “He
and his followers are always about, ready to
oblige. Things can never be said to be quiet
while they are up and doing. As for myself,
youngster, I find plenty of trouble comes
without going to seek it.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>“Yes,” added Smiles, “McGowan is a
regular border lawyer. He always manages
to be mighty near it when the trouble has
boiled. Although there’s a crowd over in
Montana that will be ready for him the next
time he crosses over.”</p>

<p>Then the conversation turned back to
Dean. Said Pete:</p>

<p>“I guess Jack will not be doing some of
the things he was in the habit of doing. Mrs.
Dean will see to that. Say, Al, what’s happened
to Amy Wells—Jack used to be sweet
on her, if I remember rightly?”</p>

<p>“Seeing that things are as they are, Pete,
and since she’s gone, I guess I’ll tell. Jack
may not like it, but then he needn’t know.”</p>

<p>“I think Amy Wells went back East. She
came back here fresh from college. Jack
had known her since the time when they
were just boy and girl pals. Jack is not the
kind that likes more than one for all time
and until now I didn’t think he’d ever like
anyone else. When she came back here he
was very bashful. It bothered him so much
that he spoke to me about it.”</p>

<p>“‘You see, Al, it’s like this. There’s nothing
here for a girl like her; she’s East all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
over. She couldn’t be satisfied out here. I
know it. It came to me a while back. She
doesn’t see me when I’m about and I fear I
don’t count at all.’</p>

<p>“Well, it was true; she didn’t seem to see
him. You all know Jack. Since she didn’t
pay any attention to him, he saw to it he
wasn’t there much. Then, you remember
that chap, Stephen Browne, with an e at
the end of Brown, if you please. He was
very good-looking. A thoroughbred, too.
You only made the mistake once, of not
thinking so. You had to like him.</p>

<p>“Well, at that time, as some of you know,
I was foreman over at the Wells, so I had
many chances to watch. I didn’t like
Browne. I did like Jack. That was so, at
first, then I found myself liking this Easterner.
Hated to own up to it, but I did.
You had to like him, he was such a good
scout. You could see how he felt about Miss
Amy.</p>

<p>“Mr. Wells just sat back and watched it
all. He was very fond of his niece. He liked
Jack and he liked this new fellow, too. He
is not the kind that would say much. Jack
Dean’s staying away didn’t seem to help<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Jack’s chances. Jack was not moping, but
he felt he wasn’t wanted nor needed.</p>

<p>“Then he had to go to Victoria. When he
came back three months later Miss Amy had
gone East, so had Browne. He never asked
any questions and Mr. Wells never offered
any information.</p>

<p>“If I had had half a chance, I’d have told
him my suspicion. But you can’t go to a
man like Dean with a suspicion and nothing
more. For another thing, it was Dean’s
fight and he wasn’t asking for any help. But
my suspicion is this, that Miss Amy didn’t
care for Browne in that way. I learned that
from a word or two I overheard. I don’t
know even now whether she cared for Jack,
she didn’t show her hand that easily.”</p>

<p>“How many years ago is that, Al?” asked
one of the listeners.</p>

<p>“Nearly three years, I think. I suppose
they both have forgotten each other by now,
at least Jack has, hasn’t he? It’s funny, is
all I can say.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m for the hay,” said Smiles.</p>

<p>Some of the men still stayed about, others
followed Smiles’ example. Red Mack, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
was to meet the returning party early next
morning, had long since retired.</p>

<p>A fast train, eating up the space, five hundred
miles away, was bringing a surprise to
all of them. Throughout the shadows of the
night and on the wings of the morning the
onrushing train with Mr. and Mrs. Dean
and Ted Marsh was speeding.</p>

<p>At four, when the sun was about to herald
the new day, Red Mack, driving a fast Packard,
started on his five-hour journey. Skilled
and expert, even as much the master of this
steel steed as of his beloved Brownie, he
raced onward at full speed, the joy of the
morning and of the wind in his blood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VI<br>

<small>DEAN MEETS COLONEL SANDS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">FOR two days the fast Canadian Pacific
flyer had raced through changing country
and towns. To Ted, who had never before
been on a railroad train, every moment
held fascination. He watched the flying
country, the busy stations and the people on
the train. Very important people some of
them seemed to be.</p>

<p>But the luxuries of the Pullman service
and the dining car were his chief interest.
It seemed so wonderful to be able to go the
distance they were going and still be so comfortable.</p>

<p>Trim and neat was Ted. You would
hardly have recognized him as the same boy.
He was thoughtful, too. He realized that
Mr. and Mrs. Dean liked to be alone, so he
passed much of the time in the observation
car.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>He was sitting out there on the platform,
the second morning, when an elderly, military-looking
gentleman came and sat down
beside him. They were the only people on
the platform, for it was a little too cool for
most of the passengers. Ted noticed that
the man was looking at him and so he smiled
in friendly fashion.</p>

<p>“Belong to Canada or United States?”
the man asked him.</p>

<p>“United States,” replied Ted.</p>

<p>“It’s a great country you belong to, my
boy. Always be proud of it and be ready to
do more than just be proud of it.”</p>

<p>“I want to, sir,” Ted answered, “I am a
Scout,” the boy added, proudly.</p>

<p>“That’s fine,” answered Colonel Sands.
“Ready to do your share for your country,
aren’t you? Well, you can’t tell when you
will be needed. If I were not an Englishman,
I would want to be an American—so
be sure to remember to be very proud
that you are one. Are you traveling alone?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I am with Mr. and Mrs. John
Dean. We are going to the Double X Ranch
near Big Gulch.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>“Is Mr. Dean Canadian or American?”
asked Colonel Sands.</p>

<p>“Canadian, sir. He’s a car or two further
back. If you would like to meet him—would
you like me to take you to him?” he added.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said the colonel, “I should like to
meet him.”</p>

<p>Colonel Sands met Mr. and Mrs. Dean
upon Ted’s introduction. Mr. Dean and he
went to the smoking car and they stayed
there for several hours. Mrs. Dean spoke to
Ted for a little while, then turned to a magazine.</p>

<p>It suddenly came to Ted, as it had not
until then, that his mother and his sister
were there in Chicago and he would not see
them for a long time. He never would have
admitted how near the point of tears he was,
as he wistfully peered out of the window.
Many things passed his view, flying swiftly
past him; but he saw only Chicago, his home
and his dear ones. He began to wish he was
home. Mrs. Dean looked up and caught the
wistful look on his face. She did not interrupt
his thoughts, but sat and watched him.
Suddenly he looked up and smiled a little
shamefacedly, as he saw her watching him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>“Well, Ted, you will have lots of chances
to show how much you are the man of the
family. You are getting older, you see, and
a man’s work lies before you.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know,” he answered soberly, “I
mean to make my way, so that mother and
Helen can come out to this country. Isn’t
it fine to know that you belong to it—that
you are an American—there never was anything
like it.” Then he laughed, a little embarrassed.
“Of course, being a Canadian is
almost the same,” he added loyally.</p>

<p>“Yes, we feel it is,” said Mrs. Dean, smiling.</p>

<p>The two men came back and Ted heard
Colonel Sands say:</p>

<p>“We can’t tell when it will happen. But
I think you should know. It is likely to
come any minute. When it comes Canada
must and will do its share. The Germans
are prepared, tremendously prepared. I am
off to Australia in a week. If you will undertake
what I suggest—I can leave with
the assurance that the matter is in safe and
cautious hands. For I want to tell you, Mr.
Dean, it is a big undertaking. I’ll see you
again.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>When the colonel left, John Dean explained
to his wife. There was the possibility
of war, the big European war that has
since come, but which then, only a few
months before that fateful August, very few
people would have believed possible. There
were some men in England who knew it
would come—but they were being laughed
at—so they had to do their work quietly.
Colonel Sands was one of these men. He had
been in Canada for many months and now
was on his way to Australia. They wanted
men in Canada, in Australia, in all the provinces,
to prepare, to do what they could. As
John Dean spoke, there came to Amy Dean
a feeling that if war did come, her husband
would be marching off to the front. And,
with this feeling of fear, there came also a
great pride.</p>

<p>Ted listened, wide-eyed and interested. It
stirred his fancy, his thoughts. He was, he
felt, an American always, but Canada held
a close second place. What if he could help?</p>

<p>Early the next morning the train pulled
into Big Gulch. A car was waiting for them.
Red Mack came sheepishly forward. He
stared open-mouthed at Mrs. Dean.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>Things simply had to be explained to him.
Ted also had to be explained. Boy and man
looked at each other with instant liking.</p>

<p>Still another passenger there was. They
brought him from the baggage car and he
ran to Ted and kept close to Ted’s heels—the
dog which Ted had named Wolf that
first day, hoping the name would make the
dog.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER VII<br>

<small>TED AT HOME AT THE DOUBLE X</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE surprise of the cowboys who had
speculated as to Amy Wells and Mrs.
Dean was so apparent that Jack Dean, who
had an idea as to the reason for it, felt quite
embarrassed. It amused Mrs. Dean, who
knew many of the men and who with great
tact made things easy. The men felt somewhat
guilty, especially Al Graham.</p>

<p>But things soon were normal again. John
Dean knew that all these men were friends
of his, that they were his peers. His position
was such that he was their leader, but
he never had to make them feel that it was
a case of employer and employee. He knew
the sterling independence of the West,
which held no man superior to another. And
no one believed in the principle more than
Dean. So that when the men were at ease
there were great doings. The cowboys,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
when alone, were crude and rough. Now,
with Mrs. Dean about, their manners were
such as any gentleman might own. Perhaps
a little rough in manner and appearance,
but not one of them lacked manliness
and gentleness, the main requisites of a gentleman.
Of course, breeding is more than
mere polish, but much more than just breeding
is necessary for the true gentleman.</p>

<p>The men liked Mrs. Dean from the first
moment. Her charm and her loveliness kept
even the timid Smiles in the circle about her.
She was pleasant to all and enjoyed their
company so much that they responded naturally
and their quick wit had full play.</p>

<p>Nor was Ted an outsider. Under the protecting
wing of Red Mack the boy had a
chance of meeting the men without awkwardness.</p>

<p>The men took to him. They tested him to
find out if there were a man’s qualities in
him. Your shrewd, self-reliant man of the
plains soon sees through a person.</p>

<p>They found Ted true. He had a good-natured
grin and a fearless eye. Green
and new he was, and many pranks were
played on him, but he took them all good-naturedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
Despite the protection his closeness
to the boss, and the household would
give him, it never entered Ted’s mind to
complain. From afar Dean watched the trying
out of the boy’s mettle with keen interest.
He felt fairly certain of the result.</p>

<p>He learned to ride a horse in quick time.
Red Mack felt that it was up to him to give
the boy the rudiments of the rancher’s education.
Ted could not have had a better
teacher in the whole of western Canada.</p>

<p>The time passed very quickly in this way.
Mrs. Dean attended to Ted’s education and
each day he had to give three to four hours
to study. At other times you could see him,
sometimes with Smiles, sometimes with Al
or Pete, but mostly with Red. Wherever he
went, Wolf was at his heels. Wolf never
would be a wolf, but he was growing and he
was beginning to hold his own. The West
seemed to be the place for him.</p>

<p>But if Ted spent most of his time while
in action with the three men mentioned, he
also liked to sit and listen to Pop, who had
taken a deep interest in the boy. The cowboys
had seen how much it had affected the
older man when Ted came. They thought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
that perhaps Pop might have had a boy of
that age and so it had brought memories.
But they forebore to discuss or to question
Pop, for, after all, it was his own affair.</p>

<p>There was, however, a good deal more to
it than that. When Pop had heard the boy
introduced as Ted Marsh, a curtain seemed
to have been drawn aside—a curtain that
had hidden about fourteen years of his life.
And from what Pop heard of the boy’s history
through Dean and as related by Ted
himself, he realized that Fate had played a
rather queer trick. There came a great hope
to Pop, or, rather, Dick Smith, as he was
known on the ranch. He dared to think
that perhaps he could come through and
that Ted would be the means.</p>

<p>For Pop, as the reader may realize, was
the long lost father of Ted. He was the Bill
Marsh that had disappeared and for whom
Mrs. Marsh still mourned, not knowing
whether he was dead or alive.</p>

<p>The hard times of the Marsh family,
many years before, had worried Bill even
more than Mrs. Marsh. A strong man, he
brooded over his inability to make things
go, and gradually, as he grew more and more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
despondent, took to drink. Then there had
been a quarrel between husband and wife,
and the man had felt that he was useless.
Mrs. Marsh had been the one who had supported
the family and this made the man
morose and bitter. He left home, intent
upon getting what he could not earn. He
had been drinking heavily.</p>

<p>The only thing he remembered the next
morning was that he had had a terrific fight
sometime during the night. If he had not
remembered it, he would have been sure to
have known of it because of the condition
he was in. He had been sentenced to sixty
days. He knew that he must not let it be
known who he was, as he did not want to
disgrace his wife and daughter. It was
while he was in the workhouse that he decided
he would be of the greatest help to his
family by dropping out altogether. He felt
that his wife never could have any further
use for him. So he had gone west and gradually
had found things as satisfactory as
anything could be under the circumstances
at the Double X. He had sworn off drinking.</p>

<p>Now Ted, the babe that was born after he
had left Chicago, was here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>He decided not to say anything, but let
events develop. He must not force himself
back into his family, for they seemed happy
and contented as they were. But he was
bound up in the boy. From him the boy also
learned much. To him, also, the boy often
spoke of the folks at home, because, instinctively,
he felt that the man was interested.</p>

<p>The winter came on and Ted found many
new things to interest him. There was skiing,
skating, and then there would be times
when, wrapped up in warm clothes, they
would go off in sleighs to great distances. It
was often 50 degrees below zero. Ted grew
strong and Wolf especially seemed to acclimate
himself.</p>

<p>And then spring came.</p>

<small>RED MACK AND TED INVESTIGATE</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TED was to leave for Wayland Academy
the latter part of April. Mrs. Dean
thought that he would be able to enter then
and still be up with his class, thanks to the
studying he had done at the ranch. Ted
liked the ranch so much he was not looking
forward any too anxiously to schooltime.</p>

<p>Ted was one of the twenty who went off
one April morning for a great roundup and
branding of cattle. Suspicion was afoot that
the Double X cattle were being stolen. The
Wells had also reported trouble at the
Double U, so stock was to be taken.</p>

<p>Ted took great pride in his place among
the men. He had begged to be allowed to
go with them, since his days were to be so
few at the ranch, and Mrs. Dean had permitted
him to go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">TWENTY MEN WERE OFF TO BRAND CATTLE</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The men had a busy day and Ted played<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
a useful part. They pitched camp early.
Supper was soon over and most of the men
decided to turn in at once, for they wanted
to start work early the following morning.</p>

<p>“Want to go a little way?” asked Red
Mack.</p>

<p>“Certainly,” answered Ted, who was not
at all sleepy.</p>

<p>“All right, then, let’s start.”</p>

<p>Off they went, at a steady trot. Red did
not say just where they were going. He
usually, Ted had found, did not volunteer
information.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you use the car more, Red?”
questioned the boy.</p>

<p>“A car is all right, but the horse for me.
Brownie and I”—he fondled the horse’s
neck—“are chums, have always been.
Haven’t we, old horse?”</p>

<p>The horse looked up at Red understandingly.
Ted hoped he and his horse, Scout,
would be on such good terms.</p>

<p>Red understood the boy’s thoughts.</p>

<p>“Treat him kindly always. Make him
understand he amounts to something, that
he has a friend. Horses need more kindness
than human beings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>They rode for more than a half hour.
Then Red spoke again.</p>

<p>“Ted, I have a suspicion there are some
thieves about. Cattle thieves. I think I
know where they are.” He paused. “I
didn’t want to say much until I was sure,
but I’ll make sure very soon. Perhaps you
can help.”</p>

<p>The boy’s pulse beat faster. He didn’t
know just how he could help, but he knew
he didn’t want to fail his friend.</p>

<p>“I know you have grit, from what Jack
has told us. But you also have to keep your
head here,” Mack added.</p>

<p>They rode about three miles more. “There
is a cave a little further up there, a good and
likely place for them. Let’s turn our horses
back into the woods here. No noise, now.”</p>

<p>Silently, slowly, they worked their way
forward. There was but a touch of the
waning day to show them the way.</p>

<p>They stopped often and listened. It was
slow progress. Then they heard the faint
murmur of voices. Mack drew nearer and
tried to make out the voices or what was
said, but found it impossible. He came back
and motioned to Ted that they were to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
back. And just as slowly they worked their
way to the starting point.</p>

<p>“Can’t tell who they are, can we?” Red
mused. “They may be peaceable, law-abiding
citizens. They might be folks with business
which isn’t my particular concern. I’d
hate to inspect, make trouble, get nowhere
and have good and kind friends tell it to
you on every occasion. No, I’m going to
make sure.”</p>

<p>Ted whispered: “I have an idea, Red.
Let me go in there, pretend I’m lost, and
that I am looking for my way.”</p>

<p>“Won’t do,” Red interrupted. “Lot’s of
reasons why. First, they wouldn’t let you
know anything and I could only guess from
your description. Second, if trouble came,
what do you think folks down there would
say to me? Nice, agreeable, pleasant things,
eh? Tell you, boy. I’ll go in. You wait
where we were. If I don’t call you, it’s a
sign things are not friendly—you speed
back and get Smiles and the boys. I think
you had best tell them to hurry, although I
don’t think they will need any urging when
they find out it is friend McGowan. They
can’t hurry any too fast to suit me, because
about the time they are due things will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
getting interesting and warm. Know the
way back, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know it,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“So long, Ted,” said Red Mack.</p>

<p>Red crawled back to where the horses
were. He rode forward as if he were going
to a picnic. Ted heard him breaking
through the brushwood, leading his horse.
Then he heard him say, “Hello, friends.”
He heard the call repeated, but there was
no answering hail. Silence still, as Red
seemed to have reached the cave, except
that he heard men moving about. Ted heard
Mack’s voice—smooth, very pleasant, and
most polite.</p>

<p>“I guess I’ll move on, since you don’t
seem glad to see me. I seem to have interrupted
you, I would say.”</p>

<p>There was a second’s pause, then Ted
heard someone speak.</p>

<p>“Throw up your hands, Red, quick. I
think, now that you’re here, you’ll stay
awhile.”</p>

<p>Ted’s heart jumped. It was beating so
loudly that he was sure they could hear it.</p>

<p>The boy wanted to stay and hear more,
but he knew there would be great need of
haste. Cautiously he made his way back to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
where his horse was busy trying to find
something at which he could nibble.</p>

<p>Once out of earshot, the boy made speed.
His friend was in trouble and he was depending
upon him to get help. Red certainly
was brave and fearless, thought Ted,
as he urged his horse to his best speed. He
was very glad that Red had taken him along
on this adventure. He hoped that he could
be of service. What if he were too late?
Faster, faster.</p>

<p>Scout proved his gameness. He seemed
to understand what was wanted of him and
he waited for no urging.</p>

<p>A little more than an hour later a very
excited boy was explaining to wide-awake
Smiles. That same Smiles had awakened
at the first call and even as he listened had
awakened the other men. None of them
asked questions. They worked on the principle
of getting ready first, then questioning
could come later. And so, even before Ted
was through, they were ready.</p>

<p>As they started off, Smiles turned to some
of them and explained: “Red has the McGowan
gang up above. Rather, the McGowan
gang has Red. He’s expecting us, but we
had better hurry, or it might get too warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>
for him. Ted was with him until Red hurried
him back to us while he palavers
with them and makes them feel that he is
all sorts of a fool and hasn’t had some such
little plan as this all along. If it was anyone
else, I’d say that they would see through it
all, but I have faith in Red. It’s up to us to
hurry.”</p>

<p>Twenty eager men, ready for anything.
The possibility of trouble pleased some of
the more reckless, like Pete, but all of them
were interested in getting McGowan,
against whom they had sworn enmity.</p>

<p>Ted was able to guide them without any
trouble. When they reached the place they
tied their horses. But as they started to
creep forward they heard something move
a little way off. Cautiously, one of them
investigated and found it was Red’s horse,
Brownie.</p>

<p>“Good,” said Smiles, “we may find him
very necessary.”</p>

<p>Some of the men had already gone forward
and the rest joined them. They could
see the cave dimly, but they could hear
quite clearly. All of the men, ready at a
second’s notice, watched Smiles, from whom
the signal for action would come.</p>

<small>THE MARSHES PAY A DEBT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">MRS. MARSH, her day’s work completed,
was doing some sewing. Her
thoughts often turned to her beloved son,
twice beloved, since he was not about. Ted
had sent her a picture of himself on horseback
and she was looking proudly at it. It
was an unusually long letter she had received
that morning. Ted had told of Red
Mack, Smiles, Pop, and the others. How his
horse, Scout, and he were great chums, and
how Wolf had grown and was a dog any boy
could be proud of. How fine and important
Mr. Dean was and how good to him Mrs.
Dean was, always. Throughout the boyish
letter, the mother read of the boy’s happiness
in his new surroundings. But Ted also
made her feel that he missed her and that
he missed Helen.</p>

<p>What a fine picture it was of him. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
manly he looked. The mother was quite
sure there never was a boy like her Ted.
But she missed him so. And, thinking about
how much she missed him, she looked for a
moment as if she would cry.</p>

<p>But instead of crying, she suddenly
smiled.</p>

<p>“I must not be selfish, as Helen says. It
is his chance. Bless the Deans.”</p>

<p>Ted in his first letter of that week had
written about the Academy at Wayland and
that he was to arrive there on May 1st. She
knew that Mrs. Dean had kept him up in his
studies in the eight months he had been
away from school, but she was glad to know
that he was again to get back to a regular
school.</p>

<p>After a while she started to set the table.
Helen would soon be home and Mrs. Marsh
was always sure to have things ready for the
hungry girl when she reached home. After
the table was set, Mrs. Marsh reopened the
letter received that morning from Ted and
placed it conspicuously, so that Helen could
not fail to see it.</p>

<p>Her thoughts still stayed with Ted. She
did not mind receiving the monthly remittance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
from the Deans, she mused, just as
had been arranged, before they left for the
West, yet she was glad that it would not be
necessary to receive this money very much
longer. What they had accepted up to now
would be paid back by the three of them,
the mother, Helen and Ted. But both of
them were very anxious to pay back at once
the hundred dollars Mr. Dean had insisted
that she take when Ted had gone to the hospital.
That was a burden which the Marshes
were anxious to clear as soon as possible.</p>

<p>The bell rang. “It cannot be Helen. She
does not ring. I wonder who it is?”</p>

<p>She pushed the button that opened the
door below. After a time there was a knock
at the door.</p>

<p>She opened it and a man stepped in.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marsh?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I am Mrs. Marsh,” she answered.</p>

<p>“I am the insurance adjuster and I want
to settle as to your losses through that fire.
The company wants to offer you $25.00,
which I think is very fair.”</p>

<p>“But it was supposed to be $100.00,” said
Mrs. Marsh, uncertainly.</p>

<p>“We cannot make it $100.00; we do not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
intend to give more than $25.00. You can
take it or leave it.”</p>

<p>The man made a move as if to go. Mrs.
Marsh, uncertain, wished for Ted or even
for Helen, and as if in answer to her wish
Helen stepped into the room.</p>

<p>“Hello, mother!” She kissed her lovingly,
then saw the stranger. She looked
up at the man.</p>

<p>The mother explained.</p>

<p>“We will not take less than the $100,”
said Helen decisively.</p>

<p>“We will give you $50, no more,” said
the man.</p>

<p>Helen shook her head.</p>

<p>“You take $75 now, or $25 if I once leave
the room.” The man started for the door.
Helen let him go. He opened the door and
went out.</p>

<p>“You should have taken the $75,” said
the mother tearfully. “We need it badly,
you know.”</p>

<p>“I think we will get the $100, mother,”
quietly answered the girl.</p>

<p>The man came back into the room. He
pulled out a paper, then five twenty dollar
bills, and showed Mrs. Marsh where to sign.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>Mrs. Marsh did so after Helen had first
read the paper and had approved of it. The
man left.</p>

<p>Mother and daughter looked at each other,
happily.</p>

<p>“Do you know, mother, I just wish we
could send it off tonight. It will feel so fine
to get the burden of this big debt from our
shoulders. Isn’t it fun to be able to pay
your debts?”</p>

<p>“I am so glad,” said the mother, no less
enthusiastic. “It worried me so.”</p>

<p>“Yes, mother, and I have some more good
news. I have been given a raise and my pay
is to be ten dollars a week.”</p>

<p>“It’s wonderful, but no more than you deserve,”
said the mother, loyally.</p>

<p>“Why,” said Helen, “here is a letter from
Ted and you never told me. What a perfectly
fine picture.” There was silence
while the sister read the letter and the
mother watched her appreciation.</p>

<p>“Ted is going to be a great man some day,
mother; I know it.”</p>

<p>“And you will be a fine woman, too,”
said the proud mother.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>“I wish we could go out there and join
Ted. In another month we ought to be able
to tell the Deans we do not need their help.
My, that will be so fine.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Helen, and the first thing in the
morning I am going to send this money to
them and get through with that.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER X<br>

<small>A LOSING GAME</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">RED had given his hail as he went forward—“Hello,
friends.” Even as he
did so, he realized who they were, for he
recognized McGowan, as that worthy came
forward to see from whom the greeting had
come. Red whispered to Brownie, gave him
a pat and the horse loped off. It was too
late for him to turn away, even if he had
any desire to do so. He saw other men join
McGowan at the front of the cave. He also
heard excited whispering.</p>

<p>No answer greeted him. There was a moment’s
distrustful gaze and then the leader
said surlily:</p>

<p>“What brings you here? What do you
want?”</p>

<p>“Nothing much,” answered Mack. “I
heard folks talking and wondered if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
wasn’t some of our boys. I went off to Big
Gulch, day before yesterday, and knew our
boys would be somewhere about. Didn’t
exactly expect you folks,” he added whimsically,
“or I might not have been so free
with my call. I guess I’ll move on, as I
seem to have interrupted you,” he added in
a louder voice.</p>

<p>We know McGowan’s answer. There was
a consultation for a half minute. They suspected
that what Red Mack told them was
not the truth; on the other hand, he would
hardly have come to them if he knew who
they were. There were no others with him;
if there were, they would not have given the
thieves time to get ready.</p>

<p>“What are you men up to? Stealing cattle
is mighty dangerous.” He sat down
and rolled a cigarette while the men watched
him distrustfully and uncertainly. “This is
good catching time, you know.” A pause.
“What are you going to do with me?” But
he seemed absolutely unconcerned as to
what they would do.</p>

<p>“Well,” answered McGowan, “we might
make you food for animals, if you really
have a desire to know. We are somewhat
uncertain as yet. You haven’t any say, although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>
I admit you have some interest in
our decision. I’m inclined to think,” added
the speaker, “you can’t harm us if we keep
you here while we do our job.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” one of the other men added. “Our
reputations won’t be hurt much by what
you may be mean enough to say after we are
through. Catching time is a long way off,
the border-line is much nearer. Day after
tomorrow the U.S.A. for us.”</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you this, Red. If any of your
friends come to investigate, you’re going to
make an easy shot,” McGowan warned him.</p>

<p>“My friends are not welcome, then?”
Mack smiled. “But why blame me, if I’m
popular?”</p>

<p>Both the prisoner and the cattle thieves
seemed to be in the best of humor. But both
sides were watching each other very closely.</p>

<p>“I reckon,” said one of the other men,
“the Double U and the Double X will not
miss what we want. We need it much more
than they do.”</p>

<p>“Well, now,” and Mack smiled, “I take it
that you need that carcass of yours much
more than they do. While folks are taking
things, we’ll probably take that.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>And so they talked, in the main, quite
humorously and good-naturedly. Mack
wondered how his friends could come to his
help without making the matter of receiving
help a matter of extreme danger to him. For
these men would blow his brains out at the
first sign or even hint of interference from
the outside. That would be their game.
They had not even bothered to tie him, simply
had taken his gun away.</p>

<p>But, knowing Smiles as he did, he knew
he could count on him. He knew that Smiles
would figure all these things before he made
a move. For his friend was a pastmaster at
this kind of game. Of course, there was the
possibility that Ted might not have brought
the warning to Smiles, but that possibility
was quite remote, so Red decided he could
count on Ted. The thing for him to do was
to be ready and act when the time came.</p>

<p>McGowan now turned to one of the men.</p>

<p>“Better get outside and watch awhile. I
don’t expect trouble, but that’s the time it
usually comes.” Out of the corner of his
eye he watched Red Mack to see if he would
give some sign, but the prisoner never
changed expression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>So a half hour more passed. The man outside
grumbled at being kept there when all
his interests were inside. His watch was
divided, half his time being spent in listening
and watching the men inside.</p>

<p>There was a sudden crashing of underbrush.
Almost with the noise a gun was at
Mack’s head. Then the call of the sentry.
“It’s a horse—reckon it’s Mack’s.” The gun
came down.</p>

<p>“It won’t be his very long,” remarked
McGowan.</p>

<p>Men in the West who know each other,
also know each other’s horses. So Brownie
was at once recognized. There was nothing
wrong to the men in Brownie’s coming to
where his master was, nothing at all wrong
in that. But to Mack it meant everything.
His horse would never come unless called or
sent. So he must have been sent. That
meant that Smiles was at hand and had
taken this method of letting him know that
it was his move.</p>

<p>He could blow out one of the lights and
kick the other one over. It would require
quick, instantaneous action, but it could be
done. Should he then rush forward and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>
out? They would shoot him if he did. No,
he would make his rush, but it would be to
the back of the cave. He would make an
attempt to escape in the dark when the opportunity
came. If he only had his gun!</p>

<p>Yes, he must make them think he was
rushing out.</p>

<p>“You know, Pete,” he talked even as he
was thinking, “I could forgive everything
but one thing. The horse is mine, now and
always. My not wearing a gun makes no
difference. When I go, my horse goes with
me. And I reckon I’m—”</p>

<p>There was sudden, intense darkness.</p>

<p>“—going now.”</p>

<p>Something crashed the next instant.
There was much noise, voices, pistol shots.
A pause of a few minutes. In that pause
Mack had managed to get outside of the
cave. The men inside were uncertain, hesitating
because they were sure they had
heard shots from the outside. They did not
know what to do.</p>

<p>Probably, too, it would have been a good
time for the men on the outside to have
closed in on the outlaws. But they also
were uncertain and the dark in those first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
few minutes helped the men on the inside.
As the two factions each hesitated, a voice
came to them from the outside.</p>

<p>“I reckon, Smiles, you can go to it.” It
was the voice of Mack. And even as he
spoke there were answering shots from the
men within at the place from which the
voice had come.</p>

<p>There was a pause. “Will you do a little
barking, so I can tell where you are?” It
was Mack’s voice again.</p>

<p>Mack saw, then, the place from which his
friends were shooting and a few seconds
later was among them.</p>

<p>“Thanks,” he said. “Pete McGowan and
his men are in there looking for trouble.”</p>

<p>“Well, they’ll find it,” and Smiles smiled
his broadest.</p>

<p>“Better come out, Pete. We’re too many
for you,” the foreman called. Shots answered
him. The men from the outside did
not waste any shots. They crept closer.</p>

<p>“Say, Smiles,” called out Pete, “if we
come out, we want your promise that there
is not going to be any hanging, but that
you’ll turn us over to the Mounted Police.
We want you to promise that, otherwise we
might as well fight.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE MEN FROM THE OUTSIDE CREPT CLOSER</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>“That’s fair,” answered Smiles. “I promise
you.”</p>

<p>“All right, then, we’ll come.”</p>

<p>They came out. To their credit be it said,
they came, heads up, as men. They had
made their fight, a foolish fight, for the
wrong-doer always pays. But they did not
whimper. Such is the stock of the West,
whatever the course they may follow, bad
or good, they are almost always—men.</p>

<p>To Ted it was a tremendous experience.
It gave him an idea as to what length these
easy-going men would go. Mack and Smiles
were his heroes, the men in turn did not forget
to say a good word to him for his part.</p>

<p>Pop had not been with them in the roundup.
But when he heard of it, he wanted to
know all the details of Ted’s share in it. He
got it from both Smiles and Red Mack. Mrs.
Dean also wanted to know all about it. She
scolded Mack for leading the boy into danger,
but she did not altogether regret it. It
would harden Ted, she thought.</p>

<p>Several days later the boy left for Wayland.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XI<br>

<small>TED AT WAYLAND</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TED had been a member of the student
body two weeks and had already made
a number of friends. Mr. Oglethorpe, who
was the dean of the Academy and a close
friend of John Dean, did everything he
could for him.</p>

<p>But it was not altogether easy sailing.
There was one boy, who, from the first moment
when Ted arrived, seemed to take a
violent dislike to him. He immediately
started in and continued to make things
unpleasant for him. Ted wanted no quarrel,
he knew that no matter how much in the
right he might be, it would count against
him, since he was the newcomer. So he
grinned good-naturedly at the many attempts
of Sydney Graham to make trouble
for him. Yet often he wished he could fight
things out with his tormentor and be done<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
with it. But better sense always came to
the rescue.</p>

<p>The studies took about five hours each
day and there was at least two hours of military
training. In addition to which Ted had
to have some private tutoring to make up
some of his studies. So that his days were
full and he did not have much time for anything
else.</p>

<p>Ted was entered in the Cavalry Division.
He rode cowboy fashion, as Mack and Pop
and Smiles had taught him to do. The other
boys all rode in the way they had been
trained, as military men ride. Captain Wilson,
in charge of the military and scout
training at the school, had decided not to
attempt to change Ted’s style of riding. As
he explained to Ted and to some of the other
boys who were about, the important thing
was to sit on a horse as if horse and rider
were one.</p>

<p>But Syd Graham sneered at Ted’s way.
There were some remarks he made that
brought a sharp rebuke from some of the
other boys. Then, too, Ted’s good nature
seemed to bring out the very worst in Syd.</p>

<p>There was to be a meeting of the Boy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Scouts. The boys, who knew that Ted had
already qualified as a tenderfoot in Chicago,
wanted to elect him to membership.</p>

<p>“I’m against any Yankee joining,” protested
young Graham. “Let’s have a little
class to it, not bring in every ordinary shop-boy
or farm hand.” He made a pretense of
being very English, don’t you know. But,
despite his objections, Ted came in. It made
him very glad, for he had never forgotten
those first principles he had learned and although
not active for many months he felt
as if he still were a Scout.</p>

<p>The Boy Scouts at Wayland were a source
of great pride to the Academy. They had
entered tests, tournaments and games with
other Scout groups. Their standing was
high. Captain Wilson spent much time and
took painstaking care that what they did
learn was the thing they should learn. He
made it clear, too, that the Boy Scout training,
while it had nothing to do with the military
training which was part of the curriculum
of the Academy, was nevertheless, in
his opinion, just as important.</p>

<p>A very little matter brought things to a
head between Syd and Ted. Ted had made<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
a two-base hit in a baseball game. The center
fielder, by quick work, had relayed the
ball to second and had made it necessary for
Ted to slide into the base. In doing this he
had spiked and upset Syd, who was covering
second. Under ordinary circumstances,
both boys would have laughed at it. Instead,
Syd, even as he arose, gave Ted a
vicious kick, then sprang at him.</p>

<p>But Ted was ready. Syd was heavier by
almost ten pounds. But the one thing in
Ted’s favor was the training of the street
gamin of the big city. He had the greater
endurance and was the quicker of the two.
He also had the experience and the cunning
acquired from many street fights.</p>

<p>No one interfered. All the boys knew
that the test now on would have to come,
why not now? Then, too, if the truth must
be told, they were not at all averse to seeing
a fight, and this proved to be an exciting
one.</p>

<p>At first, it looked very much like Syd’s
fight, then Ted’s stamina began to tell. Very
soon Syd was on the defensive, no longer did
he rush, but he became as careful as was
Ted. Then there was a cry of warning, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
boys closed in on the combatants, picked up
their clothes, and all of them started off,
the boys keeping Syd and Ted from open
view.</p>

<p>“Run, here comes Ogie and Cap.” When
they reached their dormitories the boys separated.
Ted went to his room and began
to doctor up his face. What bothered him
most was not the sting of the blows he had
received, but the utter uselessness of the
enmity of Syd. As he thought over it an
idea entered his mind. It was a sudden decision;
he would go to Syd Graham’s room
and talk things over with him. They need
not like each other, but they would come to
a clear understanding and then each go his
way.</p>

<p>As he opened the door he saw Syd coming
down the hall. When he saw Ted he stopped
for a moment, then came forward a little
more quickly. Reaching Ted he said, “Let’s
go to your room for a moment, old man. I
want to talk to you.”</p>

<p>They went in, Ted a little uncertain.</p>

<p>“That was a good scrap, wasn’t it?”
laughed the visitor. “My, but my nose and
a dozen parts of my body hurt like thunder.
You’re some pugilist and with the weight
all against you.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">THE TWO BOYS WENT ON A FISHING TRIP</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>“Look at my eye,” answered Ted. “I
think you can do some teaching yourself.”</p>

<p>“Say, Ted,” said Syd, straightforwardly,
“I came to apologize. That was a mean display
of temper on my part.” He stopped
for a moment. “I don’t know why I’ve been
this way, but I want to be friends from
now on.”</p>

<p>Ted smiled and reached out his hand. “I
was just going over to see you and have it
all out, for I have wanted to be friends all
along. Well, it’s all over—we’re friends.”</p>

<p>They talked for a long time after that.
Syd confided that he wanted to join the
British army. Ted, he found, hoped some
day to be the kind of man John Dean was.
Ted told the other boy of the ranch, of Red
and of Smiles, and also all about Chicago.
They separated at the first call for dinner.</p>

<p>Not so many days later the two boys, now
fast friends, went on a fishing trip to a
neighboring lake.</p>

<p>The town of Wayland was an important
railroad center; it was one of the keys to the
far Canadian West. The boys had to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
through the town and stopped off to make
some purchases and also watch the incoming
train. There were several people who got
off and, as is usual in a place of the size of
Wayland, the newcomers were observed
rather closely.</p>

<p>The boys had to cross a bridge on their
way back, as they were making a short cut
home and were not going through the town.
As they passed, Syd said to Ted, as he motioned
to a man sitting a little way off,
“There is one of the people who got off the
train a little while ago.” Ted looked at the
man curiously and wondered what had
brought him to Wayland, as the train that
had stopped was a through train and it
meant that the man must have come some
distance. The man seemed to be drawing or
writing, and he kept looking up at the
bridge. He saw the boys, but paid very
little attention to them as they stopped to
watch him.</p>

<p>The boys continued on their way.</p>

<p>“What nationality would you take that
man to be, Syd?” asked Ted.</p>

<p>“Search me,” answered Syd, who had not
seen as many classes of people as had Ted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
“What do you take him to be?” he in turn
asked.</p>

<p>“I guess he’s German,” was the reply.</p>

<p>The fact that the man was German
brought up only one thing to Syd—the study
of German.</p>

<p>“My father says we’ll fight the Germans
some day. So, why do they make us
study it?”</p>

<p>As Syd spoke a thought struck Ted. He
remembered the talk John Dean had had
with Colonel Sands on the train. What
should he do? Of course, this man was
probably harmless and if he said anything
he might be laughed at. Yet, after all, Ted
decided it was his business to speak.</p>

<p>He said nothing to his companion. The
thing for him to do was to say nothing to
anyone except Mr. Oglethorpe.</p>

<p>When they reached the school he excused
himself to Syd and hurried off to see the
dean. Mr. Oglethorpe was in and to him the
boy explained.</p>

<p>“Where did you see him, Theodore?”</p>

<p>“On the bridge, sir. He was either writing
or drawing.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>“Did you speak to him or tell anyone?”
the dean asked.</p>

<p>“No, sir! Not even to Sydney Graham,
who was with me. I thought I should tell
you first.”</p>

<p>“That was quite right. Let us see. I will
send for Captain Wilson.” The dean seemed
very much disturbed.</p>

<p>The captain soon arrived.</p>

<p>“I think,” said the captain, as soon as
things were explained to him, “I had better
take some action in this matter. This will
have to be done quietly, for our countrymen
still do not realize how the time is drawing
near and they would laugh at us and call us
alarmists. The fact that this stranger will
in all probability claim American citizenship
makes it doubly necessary for silent
work.”</p>

<p>“Ted,” he now turned to the boy,
“whether there is anything to this or not,
you have shown you have a good head and
you use it.”</p>

<p>Then the captain left him and Ted went
to his room.</p>

<small>THE TRAIN-WRECKERS</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap2">ABOUT three-quarters of an hour later—a
seemingly surprised (but not altogether
so) German was held up by a masked
highwayman. He gave up such papers as
he had—money was not taken—a very
queer highwayman who would not take
money. One thing he had managed to throw
into the river below, but he was made to
understand that another attempt to throw
anything else into the river would mean instant
action on the part of the hold-up man.
He was told that so plainly that he could
not fail to understand.</p>

<p>“I shall let you go,” the masked man said.</p>

<p>“It is an outrage,” said the German, but
his voice did not sound very convincing. “I
shall report it at once to the police.”</p>

<p>“You can do so, but the next time we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
catch you it may be your last time. We may
be ready for you then.”</p>

<p>The German went off. The masked man
removed his mask and proved to be Captain
Wilson. He tried to recover the paper
thrown into the river, but was unsuccessful.</p>

<p>It was but one of the rumblings of the
storm to come. One month later Austria
was to march on Servia, the storm would be
breaking.</p>

<p>From this western point another proof
went forward to a certain departmental official.
Proof that all was not quiet even if
the surface showed an apparent smoothness.</p>

<p>That evening at dinner Captain Wilson
asked Ted to come to the dean’s room.</p>

<p>When he entered, the captain and the
dean were in close conversation.</p>

<p>“We feel, Theodore, that you should
know that the man you reported was a German
spy drawing plans of the bridges and
railroad terminals. We found some valuable
maps on him. We hope we have not been
too late to intercept others he may have
drawn, although it is almost too much to
hope for that. I know that Mr. Dean will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
specially pleased because of your valuable
help.</p>

<p>“You will be adding to the debt we owe
you if you do not speak of it to anyone. We
do not report such things, for there are ever
so many who would consider us alarmists.
We are doing what we can, but it must be
done in the dark.”</p>

<p>The German spy made no complaint at the
police office. One of a wonderful nation, he
took it calmly, boarded a train to the United
States and, probably, just as painstakingly,
began the work over again in a few days.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson, a few days later, announced
that a special drill of the Infantry
and Cavalry Divisions of the Academy
would be held on the Saturday following.
It was to precede an inspection of the Scouts—tests
and promotions were to be made.</p>

<p>There were to be some officers and other
gentlemen present. He knew, he said, that
the students of Wayland would come up to
their usually high standard.</p>

<p>Many of the boys’ fathers and guardians
were to be at the drill-inspection. Syd’s
father, Colonel Graham, John Dean (with
whom Mrs. Dean was coming to see Ted)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
and about six others were due on one train
which ran from Derby, a junction station
just below Wayland.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson decided that the Cavalry
Squad should meet this train at Derby, so at
eight o’clock, Saturday morning, they
started.</p>

<p>The road runs along the railroad track
almost the entire way. When they reached
about three-quarters of the distance, Captain
Wilson ordered a halt and the boys
rested. Some of them went walking a little
way, for the captain had allowed them fifteen
minutes’ time. He did not want to get
to Derby too early.</p>

<p>As Ted walked down the track he saw
some men working on the road. He passed
them by and at a turn sat down on a tree
trunk to tie his shoelace. As he got up and
went on, the impression stayed with him
that the tree trunk he had sat on had but
just been hewn. What a big tree it had
been!</p>

<p>When the men saw him returning a few
minutes later they stopped short in their
work. They watched him as he passed on.
Without appearing to do so, the boy was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
also watching and observing. He did not let
them see that his suspicions were aroused.
When the road turned again, he hastened
his steps. The boys were just mounting, but
he asked Captain Wilson if he could speak
to him for a minute.</p>

<p>Very briefly he explained. He thought it
looked like an attempt at train-wrecking.</p>

<p>“It’s quite possible,” said Captain Wilson.
“They probably know just who is coming
and figure on maiming or killing a number
of important people.”</p>

<p>Calling the sergeant to him, he directed
that half the squad go forward to meet the
train, the other half he ordered to remain.
The boys knew something was wrong. Ted
was one of those who remained.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson took the sergeant aside
and in a low voice explained and directed
him to get a number of armed men at Derby,
as they would perhaps be of help.</p>

<p>The sergeant saluted and started off with
his men. Then the captain turned to Ted
and one other boy:</p>

<p>“Go down one mile. Should you hear a
bugle call, the train can pass. If there is
no call you must stop that train. The people<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
on the train will be on the watch for a signal,
for Sergeant Gilhooley will have warned
them to be on the lookout. It is important,
boys, that the enemy is not aware of your
presence. We shall also take care that these
men do not see us.” The two boys saluted
and were off.</p>

<p>The boys who were left very quietly remained
in position. After a little while the
captain turned to them and said:</p>

<p>“Those of the boys who would like to go
back may do so. There is possible danger
here and none of us are armed.”</p>

<p>But not one of the boys, of course, would
go. The captain stationed them in the
woods, where they were at instant call.</p>

<p>Taking Syd with him, the captain crawled
forward and watched the men dragging the
tremendous trunk to place across the track.
It took them almost a half hour to complete
the task. They did not leave, but hid in the
adjoining woods. They were going to make
sure of their job—any newcomer would be
kept away at all costs.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson saw no chance to clear the
track. He hoped the boys who had gone
ahead would be able to stop the train. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
ought not be difficult, he thought, since the
people on the train would be warned.</p>

<p>But the best laid plans go wrong very
often. The train did not stop at Derby, but
passed through. It was late and so had been
“specialed direct.” The engineer saw boys
on horseback tearing down the road and
waving frantically, but decided it was a
salute and returned it by a great whistling
from the engine. It was going at full speed
when Ted and his partner waved a red
sweater, a danger signal that could not be
ignored. It seemed to the excited boys as
if the engineer would never see it. Then the
train began to slow down, and an excited
crowd of men jumped off. Amongst them
was John Dean.</p>

<p>After the boys explained the men from the
train proceeded cautiously to the danger
point, guns ready. The anxious captain
saw them coming and used his bugle to call
the Scouts to him. There was a rush of
train-wreckers from the woods. Shots were
fired. Two of them fell in their tracks. The
rest escaped.</p>

<p>Ted was congratulated. Captain Wilson
turned to John Dean and said, with a pat on
Ted’s shoulder:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span></p>

</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>“You know, hereafter we shall call him
‘Our Boy Scout, Lucky’. But, do you know,
sir,” as Ted walked off embarrassed, “he
uses his head. I am going to tell you one
other case in point.” And he told John
Dean of the spy.</p>

<p>The train came up, so did the frantic
squad, with Sergeant Gilhooley at its head.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean came out of the train, ran
toward Ted and kissed him. Ted did not
mind; he was very proud of that.</p>

<p>The train pulled into Wayland an hour
late.</p>

<p>The newspapers called it an attempt of
train-wreckers. One of the men who had
been shot was dead and the other mortally
wounded. He would not talk and was taken
to the hospital.</p>

<p>Two days later he died.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIII<br>

<small>TED IS CHOSEN FOR A MISSION</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IT was a notable array of gentlemen and
ladies who inspected the six corps of
Scouts after the military drills were over.
As they passed up and down the lines the
Scouts, who stood at attention, eyes ahead,
heard the expressed admiration and every
one of them was proud and glad.</p>

<p>Later on Colonel Graham made a short
speech.</p>

<p>“Scouts,” he said, “you are the future
manhood of your country. Big things may
come for you to do. I am proud of Wayland
and the boys in it, and I want to say to you
all, as man to man, that come such time as
may, and there are clouds now in the sky,
Canada, I know, will have reason to be
proud of you.</p>

<p>“May I add another word? I have heard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
that opportunity has been given to one of
you to be of service. I know that none of
you would have failed, had the opportunity
come. Each of you would have welcomed it.
But opportunity, Scouts, hardly ever comes;
it is everywhere, all about you, ready for
you to grasp. It is the quick-witted man or
woman, boy or girl, who sees it. Theodore
Marsh, his wits ready, saw one thing, then
another thing, and made one and one two.
Great praise I have for him. I know, too,
that all of you must also be proud of him.
I thank you.”</p>

<p>There was the call, and the Scouts broke
up. Excited words could be heard everywhere
and many good-natured comments
were fired at Ted, who stood aside modestly,
even bashfully.</p>

<p>A little later, luncheon having been
served, the men guests retired to the office
of the dean. It was plain to almost all of
the boys that the conference, now to be held,
was the main purpose of their meeting at
the school.</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean and Ted went off for a walk.
Ted welcomed the opportunity, for he wanted
to talk of his mother and his sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>“Well, Ted, when did you write last?”
asked Mrs. Dean. She seemed to feel and
sense the fact that Ted would want to talk
about his family and so made it very easy
for him.</p>

<p>“I write twice a week, Mrs. Dean. I hear
from them about that often, sometime from
Helen, sometime from mother. They say
they miss me, but no more than I miss them,
I’ll bet.”</p>

<p>“Your mother is a fine woman, Ted. Did
she write you how she sent the $100 insurance
that she collected to Mr. Dean, because
she did not want to owe any money, it made
her so uncomfortable. You know the sum
Mr. Dean is sending every month is only
accepted by your mother on condition that
it be paid back by the three of you, when the
time comes. She would not take it any other
way.</p>

<p>“And, my boy,” Mrs. Dean smoothed into
place a stray lock of Ted’s hair, “I am so
glad that you will make good, for her sake.
Helen, too, I know, will give her much reason
for pride. It is a wonderful thing for a
mother to be proud of her children.”</p>

<p>They walked slowly on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>“I am going to make good,” Ted said,
very soberly. “For your sake and for my
mother’s sake. I owe you so much.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean continued: “I am worried,
Ted, very much worried. As you know,
there is talk of war between Germany and
England. If there is, Mr. Dean would have
to go. I would not have him stay even if he
could, and I am desperately afraid.”</p>

<p>It seemed to do Mrs. Dean as much good
as it did Ted to talk. So they spoke of the
Chicago they both loved, the Settlement,
and of the many things that had happened
lately.</p>

<p>She brought greetings from the boys at
the ranch, which made Ted very happy.</p>

<p>In the dean’s office, around a table, sat
Mr. Oglethorpe, Captain Wilson, Mr. Dean,
Colonel Graham, a Mr. Smythe, who came
from Toronto, and another man who was
addressed as Major Church. There were
several other men present, who sat and listened.</p>

<p>Major Church seemed to be the leader and
acted as chairman.</p>

<p>Mr. Smythe: “War is a matter of days.
Germany has an army over on the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
side. They pose as German-Americans, but
they are actually Germans, armed and
ready. We must watch, keep ever on the
watch. We must also watch the Germans
on our own side. These Germans are brave
and wise, as well. Dislike them as we do,
they are strong men, and we must not and
cannot despise their wonderful ability.”</p>

<p>Colonel Graham: “If we could but know
their plans, or even get an inkling of them.
It is almost of no moment for them to get
into Canada, except that we would become
the laughing stock of the world should they
capture Toronto or Montreal or Quebec.
They would enter today, then tomorrow they
would declare war.”</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Major Church, “the States
will be neutral and honestly so, but the
Washington Government cannot take any
note of such trouble in an apparent time of
peace.”</p>

<p>“When I was in Chicago, just before I
met Sands, I found out one thing. That the
headquarters of Germans in America would
most likely be in Milwaukee. It is a city
essentially German; sympathy would be
with them. But it’s one thing to know that—another<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
thing to know the one or two concrete
things they might do. That they are
meeting and planning, we are sure. To plan
to get into one of these meetings is the big
object of this conference. Is it not so,
Major?” John Dean turned to the chairman
inquiringly.</p>

<p>“It is, Mr. Dean. Our big asset now is
that they do not know we suspect anything.
They must continue not to, until the time
comes. For, if they did, it might go further
and upset the plans of the Cabinet in London.
Who could find out these things for us,
and yet not arouse suspicion?”</p>

<p>Many men were suggested, but none of
them were satisfactory.</p>

<p>Suddenly Captain Wilson spoke: “I have
just the one for it, if he will do it. He is
not Canadian, not even English, but he
might want to do it.” He turned to John
Dean—“I am speaking of Ted. He has a
good head, is cool and his youth would be a
tremendous advantage and make it unlikely
for them to suspect him.”</p>

<p>Every one of the men looked at Dean for
his opinion. He was thoughtful for many
minutes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>“It is up to Ted,” he finally said. “If he
agrees to do it, I know he will bring us some
information. But you, Mr. Smythe, will
have to get information from the service as
to where the enemy’s headquarters are at
present.”</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XIV<br>

<small>BOUND FOR CHICAGO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“YOU see, gentlemen,” Major Church
said, “if the Germans find out there is
a leak they will suspect that it leads to Washington.
They have infinite contempt for our
Government in London and in Ottawa. They
know there are a few men who suspect them,
but they believe London and Ottawa are
beautifully hoodwinked, and that these few
men are not worth bothering with. That
suits us. It would be fatal for them to have
Washington suspect them. We, on the other
hand, must proceed with caution, for they
will try to catch us in a trap and show how
foolish we are to question their good will
and intentions. Nothing would fall in with
their plans so well as to make us the laughing
stock of Canada and the United States.
So we must be equally cautious. If Washington
finds out the truth, however, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
through belief, nor even suspicion, but by
actual, obvious, undeniable proof—it will
mean that there will be reason for watching
the future actions of Germans who call
themselves German-Americans. It is for us
to get that proof. Once we get that, we need
not worry as to trouble from the other side
of the border.”</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said Colonel Graham, “Mr.
Smythe finds out from Toronto where the
headquarters are? They may know that.”</p>

<p>Smythe left the room at once to do so.</p>

<p>Major Church turned to Dean. “Shall we
go and talk to the boy?”</p>

<p>“I think, gentlemen, I will be excused. It
will be better if I am not present when you
ask him. I do not want him to feel that I
am trying to influence his decision. He is a
loyal lad and he would not say no should I
be there. You ask him. But explain it carefully.
Let him make up his own mind.”</p>

<p>When Ted and Mrs. Dean returned from
their walk Mrs. Dean went to her room.
Captain Wilson greeted Ted.</p>

<p>“You see, Lucky—I am superstitious,
Ted—so I’ll call you Lucky—I come to you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
on very important business. Not as Scout
to Scout, but as man to man. Come and
meet Major Church, both of us want to talk
to you.”</p>

<p>They went into a small room. Major
Church put aside some papers on which he
had been busily engaged.</p>

<p>Captain Wilson introduced Ted.</p>

<p>“I have heard of you, young man; you are
a credit to the school. We have called you
before us because of those qualities you have
already shown that you possess.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how much you do know,
lad, but war with Germany is near. On the
other side of the border there are many
Germans who, masquerading as German-Americans,
are Germans in reality. They
are well armed, too. We have reason to believe
that they are planning some attempt
against Canada and that they intend to
carry out that attempt just before a declaration
of war. We also believe that the meeting
of the prime movers is held in Milwaukee,
possibly in Chicago. It is important for
us to know their plans.”</p>

<p>He then carefully gave the reasons for believing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
that Ted might be successful in getting
information.</p>

<p>“My boy, Canada is not your country.
There is no call for you to do it. You may
wish to remain neutral and we do not want
you to go unless you wish to, heart and
soul. But should you go, successful or unsuccessful,
you will be rendering us a great
service.”</p>

<p>“I want to go,” Ted answered very quietly.
“Canada is second only to my loyalty
for my own country.”</p>

<p>Major Church and Captain Wilson gave
Ted a hand-clasp which showed their feelings.</p>

<p>“You are true blue, my lad,” said Major
Church. “We will have information as to
location from Mr. Smythe very soon. You
can understand the need of secrecy when
our wires are coded. By the way, Wilson,”
he turned to the captain, “you have an instructor
in German here, have you not?”</p>

<p>“We have,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“Better watch him a bit. My theory is
that all of these Germans will bear watching.”</p>

<p>Three hours later Captain Wilson and Ted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
joined Mr. Smythe, Mr. Dean, Colonel Graham
and Major Church. Mr. Smythe presented
the following wire:</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p>“Smythe,<br>

<span class="indentleft">“Wayland.</span><br>

“Ekal stroper On. 2 ecalp Ees H.”</p>
</div>
<p>“As you know, gentlemen, they have used
the simplest code because the information
would only be information for us. It is the
reversal of the letters of a word. Let us
see:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Lake Reports No. 2 place. See H.’</p>
</div>

<p>“H is Strong. No. 2 is Chicago. Strong
is our chief operative there. Ted will have
to see him to get his information and also
such help as he may need. But one thing
we know—their headquarters just now are
at Chicago.”</p>

<p>“I am glad of it,” said Ted. “Since Chicago
is my home town, I can do things there
and may be successful.”</p>

<p>“Suppose,” said John Dean, “you start
tomorrow, Ted. You see, speed is the thing.
That will give you a chance to see your
mother and sister, too.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>“I need hardly say,” said the major,
“that even your mother had best not know
about this, unless it should be actually
necessary. Secrecy is imperative.”</p>

<p>“I know that, sir,” Ted replied.</p>

<p>“One thing more,” Major Church added,
and he spoke to the men in the room. “No
matter who asks about Ted, he has gone
home to see his mother; someone is not well,
let us say. The slightest hint or suspicion
as to the purpose of his trip would frustrate
it. Will you, Mr. Smythe, telegraph to Toronto,
and tell the chief just what has been
done?”</p>

<p>Mr. Smythe nodded his head.</p>

<p>Ted went out first. As he closed the door,
another door far down the hall opened, a
head came out, a very German head—the
head of Mr. Pfeffer, instructor in that language.
Quietly and quickly it was withdrawn.
Ted did not observe this; if he had,
it probably would not have had any meaning
for him. Mr. Pfeffer was a very curious
gentleman, he would have given much to
know the purpose of the meeting; even now,
he was debating with himself whether he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
should do some innocent questioning of Ted.
He decided against it.</p>

<p>Just before retiring, Captain Wilson
came into Ted’s room.</p>

<p>“It seems silly to distrust Pfeffer, Lucky,
still when you get to a station, say Winnipeg,
I would telegraph your mother that you
are coming. If any questions should be
asked of her, she should say that she knows
you are coming. See? It is best to be safe
and to guard against everything.”</p>

<p>Early morn saw Ted on the train. It was
announced to those who made inquiries that
Ted had been called home. Mr. Pfeffer received
the information with private wonder
and doubt.</p>

<p>He took occasion to stroll down to the
telegraph office later that same day.</p>

<p>“Hello, Peter,” he said to the operator.</p>

<p>Peter turned around to see if anyone was
about, then brought out a copy of the coded
telegram.</p>

<p>“Easy code, professor—what does it
mean?” His copy already had translated
the words properly.</p>

<p>“It may mean nothing or it may mean
everything. The boy is going to Chicago—perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
Chicago is No. 2—perhaps not.
Peter, you had better send a telegram. Better
be sure, eh?”</p>

<p>“Why would they be sending a child and
for what?” Peter was incredulous.</p>

<p>“Did the boy send a telegram?” Mr. Pfeffer
asked. “I had better see them all.”</p>

<p>But there was none that had been sent
that morning to Chicago.</p>

<p>A long wire, also in code, went forward
from Mr. Pfeffer to Chicago. Then that
worthy strolled back to the Academy.</p>

<small>PLANS ARE MADE TO MEET TED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">IN a room in one of the West Side streets
of Chicago, in an old-fashioned office
building, which also rented rooms to lodges
and societies, eight men were engaged in
earnest conversation.</p>

<p>“You are wrong, O’Reilly,” said one of
them. “England will not dare come into it.
There are men in England who would want
the country to war against my land. But
the powers that be, and the people, too, will
be against it.”</p>

<p>“I hate England, Berman,” said O’Reilly.
“There are Irishmen who are willing to lick
the hand that has beaten them and has held
them in subjection, but they are not true
sons of Erin. I am against England, but I
do not despise the English as you Germans
do. Once they are aroused, mark my words,
slow as they may be at the start, they will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
be a mighty force.” His eyes flashed.
“Many people call me a traitor, but Ireland,
not England, is my country, and all
Irishmen should be against the country that
holds it slave.</p>

<p>“But to business, gentlemen. Will you,
Mr. Schmidt, explain the call for this meeting?”</p>

<p>“That I will,” answered he who had been
addressed. “There are two things for us
to take up—the less important first. I have
a telegram from our good friend Pfeffer up
in Wayland, in Alberta, Canada, where he is
doing our work, but is presumably a German
instructor. Ah, here it is—”</p>

<p>He drew out the coded wire that Pfeffer
had sent. “I have figured out the code and
it reads as follows:</p>

<p>“‘Ference eld erecon urday h atch h oysat
ed w arsh b adian t cific M eftcan erepa en l
am h alledsev ome y c ther h pect b emo
ssus n h ay i ee o trong w haps s as s persper
ay h eekpa formation m atchin s w.’</p>

<p>“‘Conference held here Saturday. Watch
boy Ted Marsh, Canadian Pacific, left here
seven A.M. Sunday. Called home by mother.
Suspect he is on way to see Strong.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
Perhaps he has papers, may seek information.
Watch.’”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>There was a discussion as to the telegram.
“Who is Strong?” asked O’Reilly.</p>

<p>“He is the chief operative—secret service
man—stationed in Chicago by the Government
at Ottawa. We have him watched.
We have even instructions out that if he
becomes dangerous he will disappear very
suddenly.”</p>

<p>“That is bad business,” said a little man
named Heinrich.</p>

<p>“Bad business nothing!” answered
Schmidt. “No one must stand in the forward
way. Germany first, last, forever.
What is Strong, what are you, what am I—poof,
nothing! But Germany—ah—” the
speaker’s eyes gleamed.</p>

<p>“It will give those who are suspicious
ground for proof that their suspicions are
more than suspicions,” answered Heinrich.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>“Let us not wander from the point, gentlemen,”
another man interrupted. “As I
gather from the telegram, this boy may be
coming to see Strong. Now, we must first
make sure of that fact, then find out what
it is he is coming for and stop him in his attempt,
if it concerns us.”</p>

<p>“O’Reilly,” asked Mr. Winckel, a man
with spectacles which carried thick lenses,
“can you or one of your friends, perhaps,
meet the boy and pose as this man Strong?
Schmidt, you or Feldman had better go to
Milwaukee and try to place the boy and get
such information as you can. But do not
let him suspect you.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go,” said Schmidt.</p>

<p>“When is he due?” asked Mr. Winckel.</p>

<p>“Why, I should think it would be some
time tonight,” answered Schmidt. “I’ll look
and make sure.”</p>

<p>“Find out his home address,” added
Winckel. “Telegraph it to us and one of us
will hurry up and find out if his mother
really expects him. How about your part,
O’Reilly?”</p>

<p>“I’ll see to it,” answered the Irishman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>“That is finished now. Oh, yes, one more
thing, Schmidt, better have Strong watched
even more closely. What is the other business?”
It could be seen that Mr. Winckel
was the moving spirit.</p>

<p>“Tomorrow, eight o’clock, here—the chief
will come from Washington. When Captain
Knabe comes, he will tell us just when the
day will be. It is very soon, very soon; the
long wait is over. Then, too, he will tell us
what we shall do. You will all be here?
Now we shall go to our work.”</p>

<p>They broke up. They were very thorough,
each man had his work assigned and
would see it carried through.</p>

<p>We shall turn to John Strong, who early
that morning had been slipped a memorandum
in code by the waitress serving breakfast
to him, announcing that Ted was to
come and to meet him. Also, Ted’s home
address.</p>

<p>John Strong was a clean-cut Canadian, hair
graying at the temples. No one knew better
than he how carefully he was watched. That
he was able to be as useful to his government
as he was, showed his ability.</p>

<p>He decided at once that he would not meet<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>
Ted. That would show one thing—the important
thing to those who would want to
know. How could he get to the boy’s mother
without being observed?</p>

<p>To the girl who waited on him he whispered
that he wanted her to arrange for two
cars to wait at the main entrance of the
Hotel La Salle at ten o’clock.</p>

<p>He strolled out and immediately felt himself
shadowed. He reached the hotel,
looked at the register very carefully, as if
there was something there he wanted to see,
then turned to the cigar-stand. Turning
around, he saw another man looking just as
carefully at that register. He smiled. Now
he knew one of those who were watching
him. He pulled out some memorandum slips
from his pocket and made some notations.
As if by accident he left one of the slips on
the case, lighted his cigar, bought a newspaper,
and sat down and lounged.</p>

<p>Another man came to the cigar counter,
also bought some cigars, picked up some
matches, and with it the slip of paper.</p>

<p>So there were two.</p>

<p>At five minutes past the hour Strong
strolled to the door, made a frantic dash for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
the machine, which seemed very slow to
start. A moment later two men entered the
machine immediately next, gave the driver
instructions to follow the first machine,
which by now had dashed off.</p>

<p>The first car went south. You may remember
that Mrs. Marsh lived north. The
second car followed. The occupants could
never suspect the innocent appearing chauffeur
of that second car, as he swore and
raved at the policeman who had ordered him
to stop to let the east and west traffic go by
at the side street. The frantic men inside
were assured that he would make up the lost
time; that he knew the number of the car
he was following. But he never found that
car. He became very stupid, although always
pleasant.</p>

<p>John Strong reached the home of Mrs.
Marsh, certain that he had eluded the pursuit.</p>

<p>“Mrs. Marsh, I believe?” he asked as she
opened the door.</p>

<p>“I am Mrs. Marsh,” she answered.</p>

<p>“I am a friend of some friends of Ted.
The main reason for his coming down to
Chicago is to see me, although I am sure<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
he will think that seeing you will count for
even more than that.”</p>

<p>“Did you get word from him?” further
asked Strong.</p>

<p>“Yes, I got a telegram. It said he was
coming to see you, but that I was to let anyone
else who might ask think that he was
coming because I sent for him. I do not
understand.”</p>

<p>Very carefully Strong explained it all to
Mrs. Marsh.</p>

<p>“It is important that these people should
not suspect that he is coming to see me,
only that he is coming home, nothing more.
It may even be, that one of them will be
here to see you, sometime today. They
surely will if they find out anything about
his coming, and where you live. I will say
this, that I feel I am speaking for Mr. Dean
when I say it will be a great service to him
and to his country.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to do anything for Mr.
Dean. You can count on me. I think I
understand and perhaps will be able to help.
Perhaps, too, my daughter, Helen, even
more so.”</p>

<p>“Will you have your daughter come and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
see me right after supper. The train comes
in at 9:10 tonight, and she will meet you
afterward at the station. She will go there
from my office. Possibly, as you say, she
can help.”</p>

<p>He left Mrs. Marsh, confident that she
understood and that she had the ability and
willingness to carry her part through.</p>

<small>TED ARRIVES IN CHICAGO</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">BETWEEN the hours of seven and nine
that night many things were happening.
Helen had gone down to see Strong.
A man, who may have been a Dane or a
German, boarded Ted’s train at Milwaukee,
and O’Reilly was preparing to meet that
same train, as was John Strong. At home
Mrs. Marsh was leaving to meet the train.
We shall follow the man who boarded the
train. He entered one of the Pullmans, but
no boy seemed to be there; another one, and
there were two boys, but both seemed to be
with parents.</p>

<p>But he was successful in the third car. It
was Ted he saw and as he sat down very
near him he pulled out a Danish newspaper
and started to read.</p>

<p>Pretty soon he looked up. He seemed a
very pleasant man. He spoke to a man in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>
the seat in front of him, then he turned to
Ted. “Have you come from far?” he asked
innocently.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” answered Ted, “from Wayland.”</p>

<p>“So,” observed the man. “Do you live in
Chicago or in Wayland?” He added, “I
live in Milwaukee, but I go twice, sometimes
three times a month to Chicago. My daughter
lives there.”</p>

<p>“In Chicago,” answered Ted. Truth to
tell, he was very glad to talk, the trip had
been a long one.</p>

<p>“Where do you live, what part?” asked
his new acquaintance.</p>

<p>“Over north, 11416 Wells street.” Ted
saw no reason why he should not tell this
harmless stranger where he lived. Although
he had no suspicion of him, he had made up
his mind that such questions he would answer,
no matter who asked them.</p>

<p>For he realized that the one way to arouse
curiosity was to appear secretive.</p>

<p>“My daughter lives up that way, too,”
the man said. He seemed quite interested
in the idea of making conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>“I will leave you for a minute.” The
train was slowing up for Racine. His telegram
was all ready except for the address.
He rushed into the ticket office, added the
address and had it sent collect, and had
plenty of time to board the train.</p>

<p>“I wonder why,” thought Ted, “he should
have to run into that station.” Ted’s suspicions
were somewhat aroused. He decided
to appear as if he had not taken note of the
actions of his acquaintance.</p>

<p>Schmidt had underestimated the ability
of the boy. He was so young, he thought,
there was no necessity for special care.</p>

<p>Then, too, he was so very affable, so very
simple. To his questions as to who would
meet him Ted answered that he thought no
one would, the time he was coming was a
little uncertain, he added.</p>

<p>“No one is to meet me, either. Perhaps
we can both go up home together, eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” replied the boy, “that would be
fine.”</p>

<p>Ted fancied by now that the man was a
German. But, then, he had that Danish
newspaper. Maybe he was not.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>“What do you do at your place—Wayland,
I think you said?”</p>

<p>“I go to the Academy there. I belong to
the Scouts—it is military and academic.”
The boy was quite young and quite simple,
Schmidt decided.</p>

<p>“Ah, that military business is bad, very
bad. There will never be war anymore.”</p>

<p>Ted wondered if the man really believed
it. He could not make up his mind. So
they talked. The man grew less and less
interested. He had made up his mind that
the boy was really going to see his mother.
Of course, that would be proven when they
found out how much the mother knew about
it and if she would meet the boy. Probably
all this time had been wasted, but Schmidt
had no regrets. After all, eternal vigilance
was the watchword.</p>

<p>An hour later the train came into the
station.</p>

<p>Ted, who had been quite tired, no longer
felt any weariness. Here was Chicago, here
was home.</p>

<p>As he stepped away from the train, his
mother and sister ran forward. Two men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
watched him from close by—one motioned
to the other. O’Reilly went forward.</p>

<p>“My boy, are you looking for Mr.
Strong?”</p>

<p>Helen interrupted: “Looking for Mr.
Who? Why, of course he’s not—he’s my
brother—I guess you are mistaken. Come,
Ted, we are going home first.”</p>

<p>Ted did not question his sister; he knew
there was method in her outburst. He
added:</p>

<p>“Sorry, sir.”</p>

<p>“I’m so glad you came, Ted. How I hoped
you would!” his mother said.</p>

<p>O’Reilly turned doubtfully, as the other
man beckoned him away.</p>

<p>“Time lost,” said Schmidt. “Let them
go. No harm done. I pumped the boy on
the way; he had no secret, apparently. He
is but a child.”</p>

<p>“I was scared by that girl,” replied
O’Reilly musingly. “My, she’s a Tartar.
All right, then, I’m tired and I’m going
home. Good-night.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, my friend—see you tomorrow.”
Schmidt watched him go.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>“Say, sis, I did have to meet a Mr.
Strong.” Ted spoke in a low voice.</p>

<p>“I know it, Ted, but that man was not
he. When we get away somewhere I’ll tell
you something about it.”</p>

<p>“Let’s go home. I’m crazy to be back
here and it certainly feels fine.”</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XVII<br>

<small>TED MEETS STRONG</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE were many eager questions on
the way home. The mother listened
with great pride to Ted’s account, even
though he had told many of the same things
in his letters.</p>

<p>Ted painted a great picture of his new
home and it made Mrs. Marsh very happy
for his sake, even though she wished a little
longingly that both Helen and she could be
a part of this wonderful and happy life.</p>

<p>Helen must have been thinking the same
thing, for she spoke out:</p>

<p>“I wish mother and I could go out there.
If there were only something I could do
there. My work here is interesting, but I
would gladly give it up for such an opportunity.”</p>

<p>“It’s all right, sis,” replied Ted. “It
won’t be long before you will both be out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
there. I wouldn’t want to stay myself if I
did not feel sure of that.” They had reached
their “L” station by now and home was only
a matter of a few moments.</p>

<p>“I guess you are tired, Ted. But I think
I had better tell you what Mr. Strong wants
you to do.” Then Helen told him of her
going down to see Mr. Strong; how the latter
had reason to believe that there was to
be a meeting of the Germans the very next
night. He wanted to see Ted, who was to
go to a certain number on Adams street at
eight the next morning. She gave him the
number of the room. Ted was to wait until
such time as Strong came. He might be
late, for often there was difficulty in getting
there unobserved. He would mention the
word Dean and Helen for identification,
should it be necessary.</p>

<p>Ted went to bed and slept the sleep of the
just and the weary.</p>

<p>That next morning the newspapers printed
in large headlines the ultimatum that
Austria had put up to Servia. They speculated
on the possibilities of war. To Ted—refreshed
and no longer weary, reading the
newspaper as he made his way downtown—it
brought a feeling that he was in some way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
involved. It made him feel quite important;
it increased his respect for the men who had
sent him to Chicago. It was big work these men
were doing; he was having a share in
it. He left the elevated station with some
time on his hand. It seemed so long since
he had been down here in the heart of Chicago.
It came to Ted that it would always
hold a warm spot in his affections. After
all, it was here he had spent his childhood;
it was to the knockabouts received here that
he owed much. If only he could be successful,
if only he could obtain the necessary information
and be able to deliver the message
to John Strong. Without knowing very
much about it all, he realized that the things
for him to do were important parts of it all.
A little uncertainly, because the subject was
a little too much for him, and he was still a
very young boy, he speculated on why nations
should go to war.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ted,” someone greeted him. It
was Spot, the fellow with whom he had had
that fight at the beginning of this story.</p>

<p>“Hello, Spot,” Ted greeted him cordially.
He was glad to renew old acquaintances.
“How’s business?”</p>

<p>“Fine,” answered Spot. “Lots of news,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>
lots of papers sold. What are you here for?
Thought you went ’way out West?”</p>

<p>“I’m just paying a visit,” laughed Ted.
“Seeing friends.” They talked for a few
minutes.</p>

<p>“See you again, Spot. Is this your regular
stand?”</p>

<p>“Sure is,” replied Spot, as he turned to a
customer.</p>

<p>Ted went on his way. Very soon he
reached the building on Adams street to
which Helen had directed him. He turned
in and when he came to the seventh floor
he entered Room 701.</p>

<p>He accosted the man who looked up from
a desk with:</p>

<p>“Want a boy?”</p>

<p>“Well, perhaps.” He sounded very English.
“What is your name?”</p>

<p>“Theodore Marsh,” replied the owner of
that name.</p>

<p>The man’s manner changed on the instant.
Ted liked him then. “Come in, Ted.
Mr. Strong is expected any minute, but of
course he may not come for a while. We
have just moved in here. We have to move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
quite often, for those Germans certainly are
shrewd. Quick, too, and they keep us on
the jump.”</p>

<p>He turned to work on an intricate little
machine which had a long coil of wire, very
thin, much thinner than a telephone wire.</p>

<p>“Do you know what this is?” Ted did
not know.</p>

<p>“A dictaphone. We will have use for it.
I am getting it ready for tonight.”</p>

<p>Ted had heard of a dictaphone, but he had
not yet learned its usefulness. He was to
find out that night how wonderfully useful
it could be, how much danger the use of it
would avoid.</p>

<p>It was almost two hours before a man entered.
When he saw Ted he said, with a
smile:</p>

<p>“Hello, my boy. I guess you and I have
met both Dean and Helen, haven’t we? Let
us go into this room.”</p>

<p>Ted delivered the papers he had brought
for Strong. Strong took them eagerly and
just as eagerly Ted gave them up. He
heaved a sigh of relief at getting rid of
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>“This paper alone,” Strong picked up one
of the papers from his desk, where he had
placed them, “if trouble should come, would
prove to the United States Government
what the Germans are doing in the States
and just how it affects Canada. Without
this it would be disagreeable to be found
doing some of the things we find ourselves
compelled to do. I see, also, that this letter
says that I may count on your help. We
will need it, I am sure.</p>

<p>“Tonight, the Germans are to hold a
meeting. The purpose and decision reached
there we must know at all costs. We must
go down there, you and Walker and I.
Walker is the man in the office. He has the
necessary knowledge to place a dictaphone
or tap a telephone wire. Also, he, another
man named Bronson, and I have already
made arrangements for placing that dictaphone
at the Germans’ meeting-place.”</p>

<p>He turned to Walker. “Are you ready?”</p>

<p>“In about five minutes,” replied Walker,
with a grin.</p>

<p>While they were waiting Strong suddenly
thought of something.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>“As I understand—am I right?—you
were a newsboy up to a year ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir, I was,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“Good. Do you think you could manage
to fix yourself up as one and meet us in
front of the Auditorium?”</p>

<p>“I think I can,” replied the boy, after a
moment’s thought.</p>

<p>“All right, I’ll give you forty-five minutes,”
Strong said, as he turned to Walker,
who was now ready.</p>

<p>Quickly, Ted located Spot.</p>

<p>“I’ll tell you what I’ll do, Spot,” he confided
to the news merchant. “I’ll give you
two dollars and my clothes for your clothes
and papers. I want you to have a share in
my good fortune and I also want to sell
papers for awhile.”</p>

<p>Spot grinned delight. “You mean it,
Ted?”</p>

<p>“Sure. Where can we change?”</p>

<p>“Any place will suit me. But I’ll show
you a place. That’s easy.”</p>

<p>A place was very easily located. Spot had
managed to wash his hands and face, while
Ted’s had not yet gotten to the color they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
should be. They had exchanged everything
from shoes to hats.</p>

<p>“Where are you going now, Spot?” asked
Ted.</p>

<p>“I beg your pardon,” replied Spot. “My
name is Mr. James Sullivan. I would have
you address your betters properly, boy.”
He never cracked a smile as he walked off,
but Ted laughed uproariously.</p>

<p>A little later two men came out of the
Auditorium.</p>

<p>“Paper, sir, papers?”</p>

<p>“No,” answered one of them. The other
took a second look at the newsboy and
laughed. “He certainly fooled you, Strong.
It’s Ted.”</p>

<p>“Good work, Ted,” Strong said, with appreciation.</p>

<p>“Slip into that automobile while we stand
in front of it.” They walked toward it.
“Now, quick.” The machine was off to the
German meeting-place.</p>

<small>SETTING A TRAP</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THE automobile came to a stop two blocks
from the German meeting-place.</p>

<p>As the three walked toward it, a beggar
stopped Strong. The latter gave him some
coins. Ted, who was watching, saw a paper
pass between the two. It was so quickly
done that he was not even sure of it. He
made no comment, as he knew that Strong
would mention it, if he thought it necessary.</p>

<p>“The room is on the third floor,” Strong
said. “There is someone in it now. That
beggar has just been up there; he has been
watching the house all morning, so that he
could keep me in touch.</p>

<p>“Suppose, Ted, you go up and sell your
papers. Go to every office. When you reach
Room 318, size it up as well as you can. See
what you can of 316 and 320 also.”</p>

<p>“All our work and our preparations have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
been from 418,” Walker added. “Our
friends are there.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Strong said, “take a look in there,
even though you will meet Bronson a little
later.”</p>

<p>A boy tried to sell his papers in the many
offices. He canvassed each floor and in due
time reached the fourth. He came to Room
418 and saw a sign on the glass reading as
follows:</p>

<p class="center">TERENCE McMAHON<br>

INSURANCE AGENT AND ADJUSTER<br>

MAIN OFFICE—OLIVER BUILDING</p>
<hr class="tiny">
<p class="center">Russell Bronson, Br. Mgr.</p>

<p>He entered. “Want a paper?” he asked
one of the men.</p>

<p>The man took one. Ted glanced about
and then went out. He had some idea of
the room. He noticed that three other doors
seemed to belong to the same office, Rooms
422, 420 and 416.</p>

<p>He soon reached the third floor. He went
through the same routine, just as carefully
and matter-of-factedly, as he had done on
the other floors. When he reached 320 he
found the door locked and a hand pointing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
to 318 as the entrance. On the glass of that
door he saw a sign which read:</p>

<p class="center">NOVELTIES AND TOYS<br>

<small>A. CHRISTENSEN</small></p>

<p>Ted opened the door. A man was inside,
his feet perched upon a desk and he was
reading a German newspaper.</p>

<p>“Paper, sir?” Ted asked him.</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer. He did not even
glance up.</p>

<p>“I have a Staats-Zeitung and a Wochen-Blatt,”
coaxed Ted. All this time he was
taking stock of the room.</p>

<p>“A Wochen-Blatt? I’ll take one,” the
man became interested. He offered a half
dollar to Ted.</p>

<p>“I haven’t the change, but I will get it for
you.” Ted was fighting for time, so that he
could form impressions.</p>

<p>“And run away with my money?” the
man sneered. “Not on your life. I’ll wait
until later.”</p>

<p>“You can hold all my papers. I’ll come
back.”</p>

<p>The man grudgingly gave the boy the
money. At the corner store Ted found his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
two friends; the automobile had long since
left.</p>

<p>“Good work,” Strong commented, after
hearing Ted. “Now, how can we get that
fellow out of the building for half an hour?”</p>

<p>“When I suggested going out for the
change,” volunteered Ted, “he didn’t want
to trust me and said: ‘I’ll wait until later.’
Perhaps he intends going out.”</p>

<p>“Well, here is one way to coax him to go
a little sooner. A German wants what he
wants when he wants it, and he never stops
wanting it until he gets it. When you go
back, Ted, insist on being paid twice as
much as the paper sells for. He probably
will not pay it. He will consider it a hold-up.
But he will want that paper and it may
hurry his departure. It is almost lunch-time
anyway.</p>

<p>“Walker, you go to all the news-stands
within three square blocks and also any
stores you may see that sell newspapers and
buy up any Wochen-Blatts they have. That
ought to keep our friend busy trying to get
what he wants and so give us more time.
We will all meet in Room 418. I’ll steal up
while you two are wrangling over your high-handed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
outrage, Ted. Walker can come any
time. There is small chance that he will be
recognized. You see,” Strong added, his
eyes smiling, “that’s the value of having the
ordinary face Walker has. He looks like
seventy-five million other folks, so no one
would notice him.”</p>

<p>Ted rushed back to the office. “Everybody
is poor around here or else they don’t want
to make change. My, what trouble.” He
was counting out the change and he now
placed but forty cents on the man’s desk.</p>

<p>The man picked up the money and for a
moment it looked as if he would not count
it, but he did.</p>

<p>“Hey, boy, another nickel! You’re short
here.”</p>

<p>“No, I’m not. I took a nickel for all the
trouble I had in making change.” Ted felt
mean and he knew his argument was a poor
one, but he was doing it for a purpose.</p>

<p>“Five cents, or I don’t want the paper.”
He made a threatening motion toward Ted.</p>

<p>Ted laughed at him. He threw the dime
on the desk, picked up his paper and backed
out of the door. The man was muttering
fiercely in German.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Out on the street our hero watched from
a nearby door. It was just mid-day and
people were hurrying for their lunch. But
it was at least twenty minutes before he saw
his man walk out of the building. He
watched him and saw him stop at one, then
at another stand and try to obtain the desired
paper. He was not successful and Ted
saw him stroll further down the street.</p>

<p>Two minutes later Ted was in Room 418.
Walker joined them almost at the same
time.</p>

<p>Ted was introduced to the man to whom
he had sold a paper a little earlier and then
the party got down to business.</p>

<p>“Walker, jump down and try the door,”
said Strong. “Here is the key.”</p>

<p>But a new problem presented itself when
Walker reported back that the key would
not fit the lock and Strong, incredulous, had
proven the truth of it for himself.</p>

<p>“Phew!” whistled Strong. “They must
have changed the lock. They figured the old
one was too easy for anyone who had a mind
to enter. Come on, Walker, we’ll try the
window.”</p>

<p>But they found no way of entering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
through the window. It was securely fastened.
Walker, with one foot on the edge
of the fire escape and the other on the ledge
of the next room’s window and holding himself
secure with one hand, attempted to open
that window also, but found it just as securely
locked.</p>

<p>“There is still one way before we think of
any rough stuff,” said Strong. With the
other three he went down to the third floor.</p>

<p>“Here, Ted, get on my shoulders and try
the fanlight. Let’s pray that it opens.”</p>

<p>It opened so very easily that they all
laughed. But they found that neither
Walker, Strong nor Bronson could get
through. But Ted could.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Bronson, “I reckon it’s up
to the boy, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“It certainly is,” said Strong.</p>

<p>Walker now very quickly, yet very clearly
explained the workings and the manipulations
of the dictaphone. Ted listened carefully
as he was told how the wires should
be laid and connected.</p>

<p>“You see, Ted,” Walker continued, “the
whole thing is already prepared. We knew
how little time we would have when the time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
did come, so we did everything we could
beforehand. You will find a place for these
wires on the wall behind the steam-pipes.
The floor moulding running along the window
wall will move if you remove the screws—four
of them. Then count off the sixteenth
floor-board—you work it this way,”
Walker showed Ted how, “and it will pry
loose. It is all very simple and should take
no more than twenty minutes. It would
take me ten.</p>

<p>“The floor-board has a little groove into
which the wires will fit. You will find that
where this board ends is another piece of
moulding which will most surprisingly give
way to your magic fingers, and the screwdriver,
as did the moulding at the other end.
On the big cabinet that is there, try that
corner of it nearest you and against the wall,
and there you will find that your wires will
fit snugly. Your hands are small and can
get in there, back of the cabinet. You just
can’t go wrong. On top of the cabinet see
that the mouthpiece or, rather, the listener,
is propped up so that it faces the table. If
you have any doubts call out—we will be
here. You will also find that it will not be
seen, for the cabinet is high.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>“Be careful, Ted, about leaving things
just as they were. It all will fit back snugly.
Be twice as careful as you are quick,”
Strong warned him.</p>

<p>“I shall be up here, Bronson will be one
flight below, and the beggar is watching in
the street. Walker will be up above passing
the wires down to you.”</p>

<p>More than fifteen minutes had already
been consumed. Strong had warned Ted to
open the window of Room 420 and, should
a warning come, hide in that room. A rope
would be passed down for him from the window
above.</p>

<p>Ted got to work at once. He found it
even more simple than Walker had told him.
In fifteen or twenty minutes he called out.
“I think I am through.” He took another
look about. He had carefully seen to everything
and there was no sign of any disturbance.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute,” said Strong. There was
a pause. Then he heard Strong speaking to
him again, “Say something right out, not
too loud, just ordinary conversation.”</p>

<p>“Want to buy a paper? News, Post,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
American, Staats-Zeitung?” said Ted to the
empty air.</p>

<p>There was another pause, then he heard
Walker say to Strong, “It’s fine and distinct,
old man.”</p>

<p>Ted took another look about. He lifted
himself on the door-knob and then eager
hands helped him out. Walker ran down
the fire escape to take a look around the
room and Strong hoisted himself up on the
knob and also looked about. Ted’s work
had been thorough and neither of them made
any criticisms.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s something of a relief,” said
Walker. Ted closed the fanlight.</p>

<p>“Nothing to do until tonight,” and Walker
grinned.</p>

<p>“Let’s eat,” said Strong. “Coming with
us, Bronson?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” was the answer.</p>

<small>STRONG SEEMS CHECKMATED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">TED was too excited to eat.</p>

<p>“Better eat, lad,” said Walker. “We
do not know when we will get another
chance today.” If no one else seemed to be
following his advice, he himself considered
it good enough to heed. He was eating
enough for two.</p>

<p>“I imagine it is going to be risky business
tonight,” Bronson remarked. “I wish I
could be with you.”</p>

<p>“It’s either going to be that, or it is going
to be very simple,” Strong answered.</p>

<p>“That is the trouble with all adventure,
these days,” Walker complained. “It’s always
so very simple.”</p>

<p>“I consider this extremely interesting
and exciting,” replied Strong. “It is like
a tremendous game of chess with enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
elements of danger added to suit the most
exacting. Don’t imagine that we shall not
be in danger every second tonight. These
Germans are cold-blooded. If we should
happen to be in their way, should they find
out how much we actually know, we can say
good-bye; the sun would rise tomorrow, but
we might not.”</p>

<p>He turned to Ted. “Well, lad, are you
afraid?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to stick, of course,” was the
reply.</p>

<p>“Well, comrades, here is the plan. The
keys you see here, one for each of us, are
for Room 420. We shall separate. At six-thirty
we must all plan to be in that room.
No noise must be made when you come; no
sound must be made while you are there.”</p>

<p>“We had better make sure we do all our
sneezing outside, eh?” Every one laughed
with Walker.</p>

<p>“It will be your last sneeze, if it’s inside,”
Strong laughingly warned him. “The least
sound, a scraping chair, would be heard.
Stay in Room 420; the fire escape makes 418
dangerous, if anyone should be curious and
decide to come up and look into that room.
Of course, there will be no lights turned on.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>“Should any of us fail to get there, he
who does must make every effort to get the
import of the conversation.”</p>

<p>“Can I do anything, before I leave for
New York tonight?” asked Bronson.</p>

<p>“No, I guess not. Get your room into
shape for us. Put the chairs where we cannot
stumble over them. How long will you
be gone?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know. These Germans certainly
keep us busy. Some of our optimists are
turning pessimists, now that Austria is declaring
war against Servia. They are beginning
to think that perhaps there is something
in this war-talk. I have to go to them
and tell them just how much there really is
in it. I had much rather stay—wish I
could.”</p>

<p>“I know that, Bronson, and there is no
one I would rather have. But perhaps you
will be of better service there. I shall code
Wright the information we get tonight, if
we get it. They will have it at the New York
office.”</p>

<p>Strong and Walker returned to the Adams
street office; Ted went home. He was glad
of the chance to see more of his mother;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
Helen, he knew, would not be home. Ted
was very fond of his pretty, efficient sister,
and proud of her rapid rise at the store.</p>

<p>He found his mother there when he
reached home. He explained the reason for
his wearing the newsboy’s clothes.</p>

<p>Ted spent a quiet, comfortable afternoon
with her. Many things they still had to talk
about and the mother realized how much it
was the desire of Ted to have her and Helen
come out to that great West, a land where
contentment and opportunity, at least, were
more likely to be found than in this place, in
which she had lived so many years.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>About three o’clock, only a half hour after
he had been at Adams street, Strong was
called to the telephone. He had been busy
at a report, the call was unexpected and
could only come from his secretary or from
Ted, the only two besides Walker who knew
of this new location.</p>

<p>It proved to be his secretary.</p>

<p>“A messenger boy came here a little while
ago with a message for you,” she said.</p>

<p>“Read it.”</p>

<p>“‘A meeting is to be held at W.’s house.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>
If you will come, can get you in. 4:30!’ It
is signed ‘J.’,” she added.</p>

<p>There was a pause. She continued: “It
looks as if it comes from Jones. It is his
writing, beyond doubt, but he signed his
initial instead of his number.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come right over,” Strong answered,
and his voice sounded perplexed.</p>

<p>Charles Jones was an operative, employed
as a butler by the Winckel household. He
had so often given proof of profound stupidity
in everything except his duties in the
household that Herr Winckel would have
laughed at any suspicion of his being anything
else but a butler. Herr Winckel was
so fond of saying and repeating that the man
had a butler mind it could never grasp anything
outside of that.</p>

<p>In reality, Jones was shrewd, keen, able
to obtain information without creating suspicion.
He had been one of Strong’s best
men and the latter felt he could count on
him.</p>

<p>Could it be a trap, he wondered?</p>

<p>Strong was uncertain as to what he should
do. To miss this meeting, which perhaps
was important; to go there, on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
hand, and endanger the chances of his getting
to that night meeting?</p>

<p>“I wish I knew what to do, Walker.”
Together they went over the phases of it as
they walked down to the office.</p>

<p>“I’d go,” advised Walker. “You say that
the boy could do his part. If they do want
you out of the way, should this be a trap,
they will hold us until morning; they would
not dare hold us any longer. And, if they
do, they will not feel the need for carefulness
and the boy will thus have a better
chance. It works well both ways.”</p>

<p>When they came to the office, Strong read
the message again.</p>

<p>“We’ll go, Walker,” he decided. “Dress
up. Be sure not to carry any papers.”</p>

<p>Two men came out of one of the inner
offices a few minutes later. They would
have been taken anywhere for two English
servants; they might have been valets, footmen,
even butlers. Each one looked the
other over critically, but the disguise was
thorough.</p>

<p>At fifteen minutes past the hour they
reached the Winckel house, knocked at the
servants’ entrance. The maid answered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and they asked for Mr. Jones. They
appeared to be very superior, upper-class
servants. Very English, too. She escorted
them in and then opened a door for them to
enter. They passed through. As they did,
each one of them was pounced upon. They
struggled against the sickening smell of the
chloroform held tightly against their noses.
Then they knew nothing more for a while.</p>

<p>An hour later they awoke with a feeling
of nausea and the smell of chloroform all
about them. They found themselves tied
hand and foot and unable to move. From
all appearances they seemed to be in the
cellar of the house.</p>

<p>“Are you there, chief?” asked Walker, in
a sick and very low voice.</p>

<p>“Yes, I’m here; going to stay awhile, I
guess.”</p>

<p>“I wonder what happened? Suppose
they got on to—?”</p>

<p>“They are probably gloating somewhere
within earshot,” Strong warned him in a
whisper. “They certainly have us out of
the way for the time being,” he added, ruefully.</p>

<p>“Well, there’s nothing to do; we’re<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
caught,” Walker said, in his ordinary voice.
Then, in a voice so low Strong could barely
hear him, he inquired, “Are you pretty well
tied? Can you do anything?”</p>

<p>“Can’t even move,” was the answer.</p>

<p>“Same here,” Walker said dejectedly.
“They made a good job.”</p>

<p>At five o’clock Ted left home for downtown.
He stopped off to buy some of the
late editions of the newspapers and proceeded
to the meeting-place. He made his
rounds through several buildings and at last
reached that particular one.</p>

<p>There was no one watching, however.
With Strong out of the way the Germans
felt quite secure.</p>

<p>At five-thirty he had already let himself
into Room 420 and was preparing to make
himself comfortable. He picked up the dictaphone
every few minutes, but for a long
time heard nothing. Things seemed quiet
and he began to wonder where Strong and
Walker were, what was delaying them. His
heart was going at a great rate because of
the forced quiet and the excited state of his
mind.</p>

<p>Things would depend on him if the two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
men did not come. Would he be able to
carry out the plans?</p>

<p>“I can only do my best,” the boy said to
himself. And there was a strong determination
to make that best count.</p>

<p>It was now half past seven. He lifted the
dictaphone oftener. Very soon he heard
voices, very indistinct, but as he listened
they became clearer and clearer. Then he
began making out the words and the sense
of the conversation.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said one voice. “We found out
that this man Jones, who was Winckel’s
butler, was one of their men. He dropped a
card which young Winckel found. That was
enough to warrant his being watched, although
we did nothing for several days except
to see that he got no further information.</p>

<p>“Today, at the point of a gun, we forced
him to write a note to Strong telling him
that there was to be a meeting at Winckel’s
house at four-thirty and that he could get
him in. Strong with another man came. We
trapped them, bound them and they are now
in the cellar out of harm’s way.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>Ted welcomed the information. At least
he knew just what to expect.</p>

<p>“It’s almost time for our friends to be
here, isn’t it? What time is Captain Knabe
coming?” said a voice.</p>

<p>“At about fifteen minutes after eight. He
is coming with Winckel.”</p>

<p>“Say, Schmidt, it was a good piece of
business to get Strong out of the way. He
is too dangerous and resourceful to suit us.”
This from O’Reilly.</p>

<p>“He has been a nuisance, hasn’t he?” answered
Schmidt. “Hello, friends,” he said
to some newcomers. “I have just been telling
O’Reilly about our little affair this afternoon.”</p>

<p>There was the sound of a number of voices
and of some laughing. Then more men came
into the room, there was the scraping of
chairs as men seated themselves.</p>

<p>Then there was quiet as two men entered.
Greetings were exchanged and Ted realized
that the two were Winckel and Captain
Knabe.</p>

<p>As Captain Knabe was introduced to
some of the men, Ted wrote the names down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>“Let us get down to business, friends,”
said one, who seemed to be the chairman.
“Captain Knabe has come here from Washington,
his time just now is important. Even
more important is the need for immediate
action. Captain Knabe, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">“I&#8202; UNDERSTAND,” said Captain Knabe,
“that some of the Irish gentlemen present
do not understand German, and so, while
I can do so much better in my native tongue,
I shall talk in English.”</p>

<p>“How lucky,” thought Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, gentlemen, I have good news for
you—war is to be declared the day after tomorrow.”</p>

<p>There was the sound of moving, falling
chairs, of men getting to their feet. Then
a whispered toast—a whisper that was almost
loud because of the number of voices—“Der
Tag.”</p>

<p>“You, in America, who have never given
up your allegiance to the supreme nation,
nor to the emperor, must do your share. Although
war is to be declared the day after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
tomorrow, it will be a matter of a few more
days before we are at war with England;
possibly it will be more than a week. I understand
you are ready.”</p>

<p>Another voice spoke. “We are prepared.
We will announce picnics at certain places;
it is for you to tell us the locations.”</p>

<p>“I am ready to tell you that now,” replied
the captain. “Concentrate on your picnic
grounds near Detroit for the taking of
Windsor. Herr Winckel has the plans. I
have given him three sets—Windsor, Toronto,
Winnipeg. He also has the charts
which show how to move and what railroads
to occupy. Our friends in Canada are to see
that there are available cars, engines and
even motors. Of course, all of you will know
just what picnic grounds are to be selected,
so we need waste no time on that.”</p>

<p>“How many men have you, Herr
Winckel?” Captain Knabe wanted to know.</p>

<p>“Will you tell us, Schoen?” Herr Winckel
asked.</p>

<p>“Approximately, armed and ready for the
call, one hundred and twenty-five thousand
men. There are also forty thousand Irishmen.
O’Reilly has them equally prepared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
and ready. Pfeffer reports thirty thousand
men in Canada, eager for the call. They are
so stationed that we can throw one hundred
and fifty thousand men on Windsor and Toronto
or such other points as are within one
half day’s ordinary travel. For Montreal we
would need eighteen hours’ additional notice.
For Quebec we would need thirty. We
figure that thirty thousand men will be
enough for Winnipeg, although we shall
have more.”</p>

<p>“The fool Englishmen,” sneered a voice.</p>

<p>“Not such fools, Schmidt. Do not underestimate
them.” The voice was Winckel’s.</p>

<p>“Everything looks so easy,” said another
voice.</p>

<p>“Aye,” said Captain Knabe, “we cannot
help but win. But the Englishman fights
best with his back to the wall.”</p>

<p>“You have your commands assigned, have
you not?” the captain inquired.</p>

<p>“We have,” replied Schoen.</p>

<p>“Now, gentlemen, here is the thing of the
utmost importance,” Herr Winckel spoke
warningly. “The facts must not leak; they
must not get to the United States officials.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
That is so important that the whole plan will
have to be dropped if there is any suspicion
as to a leak.”</p>

<p>“I think a number of us will bear out
what Winckel says,” O’Reilly spoke up.
“For myself, and I think I speak for the
other Irishmen here present and also for the
forty thousand against England, but against
the United States—never. Not one Irishman
can be counted on if it comes to a showdown
against the U. S. A.”</p>

<p>“Nor very many Germans,” added
Winckel.</p>

<p>“So be it,” said Captain Knabe. “Shall
we go over the ammunition storehouses,
those that are in Canada and those that are
in this country?”</p>

<p>Many of the places Ted could not make
out, others he did. He realized that this was
valuable information. Names though they
were, they were clues and so might be important.</p>

<p>Much more was said by the many men and
Ted stored up in his mind such information
as he thought would be useful. At half past
ten all the men had left and from what Ted
heard he understood that Knabe, Winckel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
O’Reilly and Schoen were adjourning to
some other place to perfect plans.</p>

<p>Ted cautiously stretched himself. He was
wary and still watchful. Although his muscles
were stiff and his bones ached, he had
not dared to move. When he was fairly certain
that he could move, he indulged in that
luxury for at least five minutes. He had no
trouble in leaving the building. Once outside,
he hastened to a telephone booth. He
had no intention of telephoning, but he did
want to find out the address of Winckel. A
plan was in his mind.</p>

<p>He found two Winckels in the telephone.
He decided that in all likelihood it was the
one on Michigan avenue, the other was
somewhere on the North Side.</p>

<p>When he came to the first cross street he
saw a passing taxi and hailed it. The driver
had some suspicion as to the ability of his
customer to pay, for Ted was still in his
newsboy’s clothes. However, Ted proved
he had the necessary funds and satisfied the
chauffeur.</p>

<p>Ted left the taxi two blocks before he
reached the Winckel residence. The inside
of the house was almost, not quite dark.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
Stealthily the boy investigated. He decided
that any entrance would have to be made
from the rear or the side of the building.
The rear windows to the basement and the
door he found were locked.</p>

<p>The boy studied the situation. He saw
where he could enter through one place, but
it would mean that he would have to remove
a window glass. He decided against that.
There was danger of being heard.</p>

<p>Though Ted was seeking an entrance he
had not as yet made up his mind to try to go
to the rescue of his friends. To go into the
building and take chances? But then, after
all, his information could be of use to Strong
only, for he held the many threads.</p>

<p>It would be folly to call the police, Strong
would not care to have the publicity, and
then, too, the two men might not be there
after all.</p>

<p>He decided, come what may, he would go
in. He felt fairly certain that Winckel
would not be in the house nor would he
return for an hour or more. Before making
any further attempt to get inside, Ted went
to a nearby drug store. He obtained paper
and stamped envelope and wrote the following<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
message to Strong’s office, addressing it
to Strong’s secretary, Miss Ford.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Unless you hear from us in the early
morning, you will find us imprisoned in the
cellar of Mr. Winckel’s house. I am now
trying to get Mr. Strong and Mr. Walker
out, but may not succeed.</p>

<p>“11:15 p. m.</p>
<p class="right">Ted.”</p>
</div>

<p>Having mailed the letter he hurried back
to the house. Cautiously he prowled about,
trying to find a way into the basement.
There was no way.</p>

<p>At any ordinary time Ted would have said
it was impossible to get up on that ledge,
but he managed it now. The house entrance
was through a wide door, but one had to go
down three steps and it made the floor an
English basement. The floor above that was
much higher than most ground floors and
yet lower than most second floors. Ted crept
along the narrow ledge holding on to such
supports as were there. He reached a big
window and by careful manipulation and
urging the boy managed to force it open.</p>

<p>He crawled in. Spot’s suit was very useful
now, for it held matches. Ted did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
intend to use any unless he had to, but the
building was strange to him and the occasion
for the use of them might arise. He
knew that he would have two floors to travel,
the one to the basement and the one to the
cellar. He got down the one floor without
mishap. He was about to begin the exploration
of that floor for the entrance to the
cellar, when he heard the key being inserted
into the street door.</p>

<p>His heart leaped within him. Two people
entered, a man and woman. They switched
on a light. If these people had come thirty
seconds earlier he would have been caught
coming down the stairs, Ted thought, as he
crouched behind the turn of the staircase.</p>

<p>“It was nice of you to see me home, Mr.
Erkin,” said the young lady. “Will you be
good enough to let the light burn, as some
of the folks are not in yet? Come and see
me sometime.”</p>

<p>“Good-night, thank you, I will,” the man
answered and left.</p>

<p>The boy thought, “Well, I certainly
should be called Lucky. Here I wonder how
to find an entrance to the cellar and they are
kind enough to turn on a light for me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>It was fairly easy for Ted to find his way
now, but because of the light he had to use
even greater care.</p>

<p>The cellar seemed deserted, when he got
there. It was pitch dark and it took several
minutes for him to grow accustomed to the
extreme darkness. Then he heard the faint
murmur of voices.</p>

<p>Strong and Walker had slept fitfully and
had been wide awake at various times.
Strong had again been awakened and was
insisting that Walker listen to him.</p>

<p>As Ted drew nearer, he heard Strong say,
“I don’t think, the way I feel, I shall ever
be able to move again. But if I knew that
Ted was just the least bit successful I could
be forever content.”</p>

<p>“The poor child—if he did anything at
all,” Walker answered, “it would be wonderful.
It’s a man’s job, what, then, could
a boy do?”</p>

<p>As if in answer to the question, they heard
a low voice call, “Mr. Strong, Mr. Strong!”</p>

<p>“Who is that?” the startled voice of
Strong demanded.</p>

<p>“It’s me, Ted!” said that ungrammatical
young man, a bit excitedly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span></p>

<figure class="figcenter illowe28_125" id="i_179">

  <figcaption class="caption"><p class="caption">TED FREES THE PRISONERS</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>“God bless you, boy. Is it really you?
Have you a match?”</p>

<p>Ted struck one. Hurriedly he untied the
two men, who were already questioning him
excitedly and to whom he whispered assurances.</p>

<p>As they turned the corner (having left the
building without trouble) Strong looked
back. An auto passed north on Michigan
avenue.</p>

<p>“That’s Winckel’s car,” he said. “We
weren’t any too soon.”</p>

<p>Ted told the two men of the night’s adventures
and they both listened eagerly.
Strong was laboring under great excitement
as the boy went on with his story. When
Ted was through he placed his hand on
Ted’s shoulder and said, quietly and very
impressively, to him:</p>

<p>“I simply can’t tell you the things I long
to say. You’re going to be a man, my boy!
This is a day’s work of which you will always
be proud.</p>

<p>“Knowing what we know, we can go to
sleep tonight, awake in the morning with a
plan as to just what we will do. I could
almost cry with contentment. This news<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
you bring is what we have long striven to
learn, and along comes Ted Marsh—Lucky,
the Boy Scout—and makes Canada and
England his very grateful and humble servants.</p>

<p>“There are several things we know we
can do now,” he added. “We had best take
a night to sleep it over.”</p>

<p>“You are a wonder, Ted, my friend,”
added Walker.</p>

<p>“Come, let us go,” said Strong.</p>

<p>“We are all weary. I hate to leave you.
I’d like to celebrate, but I guess we had
better postpone it until tomorrow. See you
at eight.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXI<br>

<small>WINCKEL CALLS A HALT</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">THERE were glaring headlines in the
newspapers the next morning. War was
on. People who had doubted all along, who
could not believe it possible, now had to believe.
And, although England was as yet
not involved, no one was optimistic enough
to imagine that she would stay out of it.</p>

<p>Around newspaper offices, everywhere,
excited, eager groups discussed it all. Many
a man heard the thrilling call of his native
land and many listened and made plans to
return to either Germany, Russia, England
or France.</p>

<p>Yet neither in headlines nor in the ordinary
run of news, was there mention made
of the events of our story. Silent, powerful
forces were at work to keep it quiet.</p>

<p>The automobile of Herr Winckel stopped
before his house and from it Schmidt,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">[183]</span>
O’Reilly and the owner alighted. They
made their way to the cellar, a precaution
as to the safekeeping of the prisoners.
O’Reilly and Schmidt were to be guests of
Winckel for the night. Much work had been
planned for the morning.</p>

<p>“Quiet, aren’t they?” said Schmidt, as
Winckel started to turn on the light.</p>

<p>“I guess they are asleep,” remarked
O’Reilly. The light glared. A moment’s
hush. There were astonished and wondering
exclamations. The ropes which had
held the prisoners tied, were strewn about,
but the prisoners were nowhere.</p>

<p>“What can it mean?” exclaimed Winckel,
searching vainly for an explanation.</p>

<p>Wild guesses were made by the three as
to how the escape was made.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Winckel after awhile,
“never mind how they escaped, the important
thing is—how much have they found
out of our plans.” He showed plainly how
disturbed he was.</p>

<p>“How can they have found out about our
plans? Pretty far fetched to imagine that
they could have obtained any information—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
chances are that they did not escape
until late this evening.”</p>

<p>O’Reilly interrupted Schmidt. “Is there
any way in which we can find out the last
time someone in the house saw the prisoners?”</p>

<p>“Good idea,” said Winckel. “We shall
soon find out.”</p>

<p>The household was awakened. Inquiries
and investigation showed that Lauer, a
trusted employee of Winckel, had taken a
last look at the prisoners at about ten
o’clock. He was certain of that; he had
heard their voices, although he could not
make out what they spoke about.</p>

<p>There were sighs of relief from Schmidt
and O’Reilly, who felt that the situation
was covered, but Winckel was more skeptical
and less canny.</p>

<p>“I will admit that they were here until
ten o’clock and later. I will even admit
that they were not listening at the conference.
But how was their escape managed
and why after ten? Did they have outside
help and how did the outside help know of
their imprisonment here?</p>

<p>“Both of you gentlemen may be tired and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>
may wish to retire. Please do so, if you
want to. I am going down to our meeting-place
to see what I can see. A little late,
I will admit, and it may not do us much
good, but there is always a chance. It is
important for us to find out if we have
blundered, if our plans have been disclosed.”</p>

<p>Both Schmidt and O’Reilly insisted on
accompanying Winckel and the three left the
house in the next five minutes.</p>

<p>They reached the building in about twenty
minutes. No policeman was about to see
them violate the speed laws on the way.
An immediate and careful search of the
room was made, to see if anyone had been
there since they left and also for any clue
as to the probable leak.</p>

<p>“Nothing seems wrong as far as I can
see,” O’Reilly started to say. “Hello, what
is this?” He had discovered the cleverly
concealed wires of the dictaphone. Winckel
and Schmidt joined him on the instant.
They traced the wires and soon found out
the whole layout.</p>

<p>“Mischief is certainly afoot,” exclaimed
Schmidt. The other men said nothing, but
studied the proposition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>“There still is a chance,” said O’Reilly
in an unconvincing manner—as if he wanted
to believe something his better sense did not
permit him to do, “that this outfit was not
used since Strong and the other man had
been kept from it.”</p>

<p>A sickening thought at the same instant
came to Schmidt. “O’Reilly, we talked
about the prisoners, how we had trapped
them, where they were—and all the time
someone was listening. That someone heard
all we had to say and then, after we were
all through, he went up to Winckel’s house
and rescued them.”</p>

<p>Winckel said nothing for many minutes;
he seemed lost in thought. The other men
waited for him to speak. Finally he did.</p>

<p>“We are a lot of dunces. We were so sure
of ourselves, we felt we were so wise. Pride
goeth before a fall and we fell. We must
give up our plans. It is up to both of you
to get busy, we still have time to keep out
of trouble. There is a ray of comfort in
that, at least.”</p>

<p>“I hate to think what Knabe and the others
at the embassy will think,” was the rueful
comment of Schmidt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>“Don’t let that bother you. This plan
has failed, we must plan again—when again
we match wits, let us hope we shall be more
careful and consequently more successful.
Come, enough of post mortems, let’s get
busy.”</p>

<p>It was a busy night for all of them. There
were many men who had to be seen and who
in turn had to see others. It was, so they
explained to the others, a matter of life
and death that all preparations cease at
once, as there would be close and careful
watch kept. There was much telephoning
and telegraphing to the friends who were in
other cities.</p>

<p>There can be nothing but thorough admiration
for the effective, capable way these
men went about calling a halt to all activities.
Like a perfect, well oiled machine
which slows down and then ceases its movements,
until there is something tremendously
impressive in its inaction and silence;
like a well-drilled army which retreats magnificently
and in its very retreat almost
gains a victory, so much like all this, was the
action and the work of these men at this
time. They were obeyed as only the Germans<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
know how to obey. By morning, there
was no sign, no clue to their plans and activities.
One thing only remained to prove the
danger to Canada that had been. Arsenals
and warehouses holding weapons and vehicles
of war were found at the places shown
on the list that Ted had copied.</p>

<p>At Ottawa and a little later in London and
in Washington, the powers—the men at the
helm—found out that what would in all
probability have been a successful invasion
of Canada had been checked. And they
found out, too, just how and in what way it
had been done.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">CHAPTER XXII<br>

<small>AT OTTAWA</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“COME in, both of you,” Strong called
from the inside office. Ted had shown
up at Strong’s office early the next day. He
found Strong at his desk and he found afterwards
that he had been there for more than
two hours. His secretary told Ted that he
was telephoning long distance and that Ted
should wait. When the operative was
through talking, he came out and saw Ted.</p>

<p>“Sit down a few minutes, Ted, I shall be
busy,” he had said. He had returned to his
office and proceeded to do some further telephoning.
Walker had come in a little later
and the two were busy going over the evening’s
events when Strong called out as
above.</p>

<p>“Well, Ted, I guess we are going to have
war. At least we won the first victory, or
rather you did.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>Ted fidgeted at the praise and grinned
sheepishly.</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Walker, “if they have
found the dictaphone as yet.”</p>

<p>“You can safely figure on the fact that
they did. They started a little investigation
when they found that the birds had flown.
But it does not matter how much they know
we know, now. It’s a fight in the open from
now on. I’m thankful for that.</p>

<p>“I have already notified Ottawa, New
York, and the different capitals of the provinces.
Washington also knows, our embassy
has already notified them as to the location
of the arsenals. They are going to issue orders
from Ottawa to confiscate those in our
own country at once.</p>

<p>“Ottawa wanted all the facts and it got
them. I expect to hear further from them
in the course of the day.”</p>

<p>“I wonder,” said Walker, “if our friends
will be polite enough to return my dictaphone.
They should, it does not belong to
them and they probably know to whom it
does belong.”</p>

<p>“You might go over and claim it,” answered
Strong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>“I think I will, just to see old Winckel’s
face.”</p>

<p>Strong turned to Ted.</p>

<p>“Dear lad,” he said, “what you did isn’t
the kind of thing that can appear in the
newspapers, but it is the kind about which
history is made. It is a big job you have
accomplished. The men who sent you down
to us made no mistake in their judgment as
to what you could do. Sir Robert Wingate
wanted to know all about you, I must have
talked to him for more than twenty minutes
on the telephone.</p>

<p>“Walker and I go to Ottawa on a late
train today. They want to see me, to go
over details.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s get busy with the last threads
of what happened last night—we have to
put it down on black and white for future
reference. When do you want to return to
Wayland, Ted?”</p>

<p>“I should like to go by Saturday, if it can
be arranged,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“Well, I think it can be done. I shall return
tomorrow night or early the following
morning. You will be free for these two
days. Have a good time; remember, we pay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
all your expenses—nothing is too good for
you. If you can, come down the day after
tomorrow. I may have some news for you.”</p>

<p>“I shall be glad to come down,” answered
Ted, as he wondered at the news to which
Strong had reference.</p>

<p>They spent a half hour or more going over
the events of the evening, Strong’s secretary
taking notes. Then Ted left and returned
home.</p>

<p>That afternoon he took his mother to the
ball game and saw the Cubs defeat the
Giants. He tried to explain the game to his
mother, who pretended an interest and tried
hard to understand. But she found her truant
fancy going elsewhere—it centered
about this boy of hers, her daughter and also
about the husband who could not endure
the troubleous times, not because of the
hardship to himself so much as the hardship
to her and the child.</p>

<p>Ted’s interest was not divided, however,
except in rare moments when he would turn
to his mother and accuse her of lack of interest.
She would flush guiltily and pretend
that she was interested. She would ask a
question or two, but her very questions convicted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
her, showed her inability to understand,
and Ted gave it up as a hopeless job
and comforted himself in the belief that only
men understood the game, it was too deep
for women, excepting one or two, who knew
something.</p>

<p>As they rode home the boy and the mother
discussed the improvement in their condition.</p>

<p>“We will never have to worry any more,
mother, not as long as I am able,” the boy
said, with all of youth’s surety and confidence.</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh wiped an unbidden tear from
her eye.</p>

<p>“I am very happy, dear. And yet, I
would give so much if your father was one
of us. He was a fine man, but things were
against him, too much so.”</p>

<p>Ted did not answer, he felt that nothing
he could say would help.</p>

<p>After a long period of quiet, the boy spoke
a little more quietly: “Never mind, mother,
you have Helen and me.”</p>

<p>“I am happy in my riches,” answered the
mother proudly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>When they reached home, both of them
began to get the supper ready so that Helen
would not have to wait. A brilliant idea
came to Ted as they prepared. “Mother,”
he said excitedly, “let’s not eat at home tonight.
We are going to the theater, so let us
have supper out.”</p>

<p>At first the mother demurred, but she
gave way—there was great temptation in
the unusual treat. When Helen came home
and was told the plan she was even more
excited than they; it was so unusual an adventure.
You can readily believe that it
was a happy party of three that repaired to
one of the many nice restaurants in the loop
and afterward to the theater. They did not
reach home until late in the night. On the
way home they discussed what the news
could be that Strong would have for Ted.</p>

<p>The next day Ted spent at the Settlement,
renewing old acquaintances. Miss White,
who had taken Mrs. Dean’s place, was glad
to see him and gave him a hearty welcome.
She was greatly interested in his story of
his year in the West and wanted to know all
about Mrs. Dean. It was a great day for
Ted and the pleasantest of his stay in
Chicago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>On his way home that night Ted began to
wish for Wayland. He had not realized how
much the place meant to him until now.
Syd Graham and the rest of the boys seemed
very dear, very desirable.</p>

<p>“I hope,” he said to himself, “that nothing
will keep me from going on Saturday.”</p>

<p class="drop-cap">SIR ROBERT WINGATE listened while
John Strong told the story of the plotting
and counterplotting in Chicago. Many
times he made memorandums. He asked
questions once or twice, but in the main he
just listened. When Strong finally completed
his account, Sir Robert said:</p>

<p>“We took immediate action at our end
and the results are more than satisfying.
Strong, I do not want you to think for a
minute that the importance of what you
men have done is underestimated. The excitement
of the Great War, the necessity of
secrecy as to what you have accomplished—all
these facts may give you an idea that we
do not consider your work as important as it
is. We do, however. Now, as to this boy,
Theodore Marsh. He must be an unusual<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
youngster with a good head. He will bear
watching.”</p>

<p>“Unfortunately for us, he is American.
Those are the kind of boys Canada could use
to advantage. Not only is he American, but
loyally so.”</p>

<p>“Well, he shall have acknowledgment of
his deed of service. Tell me, is he from a
family of wealth?”</p>

<p>Strong briefly gave Sir Robert an account
of Ted’s past. The latter nodded his head
understandingly.</p>

<p>“I think we will also give a more practical
acknowledgment of the value of his service.
The Government, I am sure, will be glad to
give a reward of $1,000.00 to him. When
you go back to Chicago, you will give him a
letter from me which will also hold a check
for that amount.”</p>

<p>You would think that both Strong and
Walker were the ones who were receiving
the money, they showed how glad they were.</p>

<p>Strong could not complete his work until
late in the afternoon. Walker and he boarded
a train which brought them into Chicago
about three o’clock the next afternoon.</p>

<p>“This letter and the enclosure will be a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
great surprise to Ted, won’t it?” said
Walker. “I certainly am glad of it; he
surely deserves it.”</p>

<p>“That he does, and I am just as glad.
Let me manage the business of letting him
know about it.”</p>

<p>When they reached the office, Ted had
already been there. He had left, saying that
he would be back at two o’clock, when told
that Strong would not arrive until the afternoon.</p>

<p>Promptly at two Ted showed up. Strong
saw him as he opened the door and greeted
him warmly.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ted; it’s good to see you. We
certainly shall miss you when you go back
to Wayland. But I guess you will be glad
to be back, won’t you?”</p>

<p>“I certainly will. I am going by way of
Big Gulch and shall stop off at the ranch for
a day or so.”</p>

<p>“That’s a splendid idea, isn’t it?” commented
Walker.</p>

<p>“Well, Ted, hear anything more from our
friends, the enemy?” asked Strong, laughingly.</p>

<p>“No, sir, but then I would not be the one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
to hear. I thought Mr. Walker would, he
was going to claim his property.”</p>

<p>They all laughed.</p>

<p>“By Jove, I must do that; I have completely
forgotten it,” remarked Walker.</p>

<p>“Well, Ted, they were very nice at Ottawa.
I understand the Government is going
to honor you in some way for your service;
they even spoke of doing the same thing for
both Walker and myself.”</p>

<p>Strong gave Ted an outline of what had
happened, but made no mention of the letter
from Sir Robert. Walker was tempted to
remind him, thinking that he had forgotten,
but he remembered that Strong had said he
wished to handle that end himself.</p>

<p>“I suppose you will be busy packing and
getting ready tomorrow. You leave at four
on Saturday afternoon? Come down and
see us before you go. When we need your
services again, we’ll have you come on.”</p>

<p>Ted got up to go. As he opened the door,
Strong called to him.</p>

<p>“I say, Ted, I almost forgot another thing
which probably is not very important. I
have a letter for you; silly, not to have remembered.”
And Strong smiled, while
Walker laughed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>“For me?” said Ted wonderingly, as he
took the letter. Then, as he opened it, he
saw the check. He looked at it a little dazed.
He saw his name as if in a haze—then he
saw the amount.</p>

<p>“One thousand dollars—and for me?”
He stammered the words, he was almost
stricken dumb.</p>

<p>“Yes, for you—to do with as you will.
You certainly deserve it,” said Strong.</p>

<p>“Every bit of it,” added Walker.</p>

<p>Ted had a feeling as if he wanted to cry.
He did. Walker patted him on the shoulder
understandingly, while Strong looked out of
the window and pretended he did not see.</p>

<p>“There is a letter which you might be glad
to read and which I think will be almost as
welcome as the money.” Strong turned
round and faced him as he said this.</p>

<p>The boy opened the letter.</p>

<div class="blockquot">
<p class="right">“August 2, 1914.</p>

<p>“Master Theodore Marsh,<br>
<span class="indentleft2">“Chicago, Illinois.</span></p>

<p>“Dear Theodore:</p>

<p>“Mr. Strong has advised me as to the
service you have done Canada. It has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>
a big service, one that Canada must remember.
I want you to know that it does and
will. You have shown a capacity for thinking,
for doing the right thing at the right
time. I think even better than both these
things, though, has been the simple way in
which you have carried out instructions
when conditions were such as to put up to
you the burden of necessary action. What
would have been a remarkable accomplishment
for a man is a tremendous accomplishment
for a boy.</p>

<p>“I regret the fact that you are not Canadian
but am glad you are a loyal American.
Your country is fortunate in having a boy of
your kind. I hope you will have the future
that your present action promises.</p>

<p>“The enclosed, in a small way, signalizes
a reward for your invaluable services.</p>

<p>“I hope to have the pleasure of meeting
you at some time, and I am,</p>

<p class="right"><span class="indentright">“Very sincerely yours,</span><br>
“Robert Wingate.”</p>
</div>

<p>“That’s a fine letter, isn’t it?” said Ted,
when he finished. He spoke in a low voice—he
did not trust his feelings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>“Yes, it’s fine. Sir Robert is a great man.
He does things in a big way. But I think
you want to go home now, so go.”</p>

<p>And Ted did.</p>

<small>TED GOES BACK</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">“BUT, Ted, it would be impossible for us
to go on Saturday. I am not so sure
that we can go at all, it will require a lot of
thinking.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Marsh had heard the wonderful news
and Ted’s sudden plan for them to go out to
Big Gulch or Wayland. She was trying to
show Ted how impossible it was for them to
do it and he was only just beginning to
acknowledge that perhaps Saturday would
be too soon.</p>

<p>“Well, I tell you, mother. Maybe Saturday
is too soon, but you will be ready in two
weeks—that is plenty of time. I know that
Helen will be able to do whatever she wants
to do out there—and this money, after we
have repaid the Deans, will help to tide over
the time until we are settled. We shall hear<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
what Helen says—and I shall speak to Mr.
and Mrs. Dean when I get out there.”</p>

<p>Helen was told the news almost before she
passed the doorstep. She was astonished
and glad and cried all in the same minute.</p>

<p>“How wonderful!” she finally managed
to say.</p>

<p>Then she was told of Ted’s plan. The boy
had thought that she might need convincing,
but she agreed almost at once.</p>

<p>“I know I can obtain a position in my line
of work out there. It is a land of opportunity
and we should grasp the chance to get
out there.”</p>

<p>All that remained was for Ted to get the
opinion of the Deans.</p>

<p>Ted went down to say good-bye to Strong
and Walker the next day. Both men were
very busy, but the three had lunch together
and Ted promised to write to both of them.</p>

<p>“You may have to write both of us at the
front—we shall go off to the war—that is,
Walker will. It may be my bad luck to have
to stay on duty here, although I have asked
to be relieved.”</p>

<p>“Well, Ted,” said Walker, “I shall see
you at the train.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>“And I will try to do so,” added Strong.</p>

<p>The boy told both his friends of the plan
to bring his mother and sister out West.
They agreed that it was a good plan.</p>

<p>His mother and sister, and Walker and
Strong saw him depart. It was just a year
before that Ted had left, what a big year it
had been.</p>

<p>Ted’s thoughts turned to the ranch. He
was eager to see Red Mack, Smiles, Graham,
Pop, and the Deans. He hoped it would
be Red who would meet him—and that he
would bring his horse down so that they
could go back to the ranch on horseback.
Of course, in all likelihood, it would be the
Packard that would come down for him, for
the distance was long and it would mean a
lot of extra trouble for Red or anyone to
lead his horse down all the way. The trip
to Big Gulch seemed long because of the
boy’s eagerness to see his friends. He
awakened very early on the second morning
when the train was due. When the train
finally reached the station, he eagerly looked
out to see who was there. But he could see
no one until he stepped from the train.</p>

<p>There stood Red and next to him Pop.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>
There were three horses and one of them
was his.</p>

<p>Glad greetings were exchanged.</p>

<p>“My, I’m glad you came for me on horseback.
I hoped you would, but it seemed too
much to expect.”</p>

<p>“Well, we figured you would like it. Glad
you do.”</p>

<p>They started off. As best he could, Ted
told his story and both of the men listened
with different interest. When Ted came to
that part where it had practically been
settled that his mother and Helen were
to come out, a queer look came into Pop’s
eyes which neither of them saw. The older
man rode behind most of the way after that.</p>

<p>“You should see Wolf, you would not
know him,” said Red.</p>

<p>“I guess he would not know me, either,”
answered Ted.</p>

<p>“He may be your dog, but I’m kind of attached
to him myself,” remarked Red.</p>

<p>Some time in the afternoon they reached
the ranch. Smiles was there and so were
the other men and they gave Ted a great
welcome.</p>

<p>So did Wolf, who had grown wonderfully,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>
and who, while he did not look like any
particular kind of dog, showed himself to
have an individuality, all his own. He
sprang at Ted and barked his delight. It
made Ted feel good to have the dog remember
him. It was queer to see how the dog
tried to pay attention to both Red and Ted,
and it made the men laugh at his double
devotion.</p>

<p>Ted hurried to the house where Mrs. Dean
was waiting for him. She showed how glad
she was to see him.</p>

<p>“Mr. Dean will be back a little later. He
has been very busy.”</p>

<p>Ted thought he would wait with his news
until later and merely mentioned some of
the things that had happened.</p>

<p>“Ted, dear,” said Mrs. Dean, “I want to
tell you that we are going to have a little
stranger in this house, soon.” Then Ted
knew why he had hesitated about blurting
out his news—there was an even bigger
event to happen.</p>

<p>“I’m so glad,” said he.</p>

<p>He stayed a little while only, as Mrs. Dean
did not seem strong.</p>

<p>He saw Dean when he came home. To<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
both of his friends he told his news, what
had been done, he showed Sir Robert’s letter
and then spoke of his plan for his mother
and sister.</p>

<p>“How wonderful,” said Mrs. Dean, while
John Dean looked tenderly at her.</p>

<p>“I’m proud of you, Ted. I counted on
you, but you did much more. I heard from
Strong, but I did not know what had been
accomplished. As to your mother and sister—they
must come out here—the wonderful
thing is that Mrs. Dean will need your
mother’s help very soon and it all seems to
fit one thing into another. Helen will get a
rest here; she need not worry as to finding
the right kind of opportunity. When do you
expect to write home?”</p>

<p>“At once,” answered Ted.</p>

<p>“The sooner they come the better, although
I suppose it will be every bit of two
weeks.”</p>

<p>Ted started to leave his friends to rejoin
Red and the rest. Dean caught up with him
about one hundred yards from the house.</p>

<p>“You know, Ted,” he started without any
preamble, “I feel as if my country is calling
me. I cannot think of going until the child<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
is born and Mrs. Dean is well. But I shall
have to, hard as it may be. That is one reason
why I shall be glad to have your sister
and your mother here. They will be company
for Mrs. Dean. She agrees with me
that I should go. She is the bravest, best
woman in the world.” He stopped for a
minute. “I shall see you later, as soon as
Mrs. Dean takes her rest. I want to know
all about Chicago and what happened.”</p>

<p>He returned to the house while Ted joined
the men.</p>

<p>They were in the midst of a discussion of
the war. Ted listened. Smiles and several
of the other men were leaving in three days—off
for the war. Red was not going—he
was American. “I may go later, if they
need me,” he said. There was to be a great
shortage of men at the ranch.</p>

<p>Dean had made Pop the new foreman to
take Smiles’ place. Pop was not in the
conversation, he was sitting by himself and
he showed every desire to be left alone.
After a little while, he left the room.</p>

<p>It made the war very near and Ted felt
very lonely to hear that these friends of his
were going off, some of them never to return.</p>

<small>THE MARSHES REUNITED</small></h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">POP entered the house. He wanted advice
and he wanted it bad. He knew
that ordinarily he would have gone to Mrs.
Dean—a woman would help so much at a
time like this. But Dean met him in the
hall.</p>

<p>“Hello, Pop—what’s the trouble?” asked
Dean.</p>

<p>“Hello, Jack. I can’t say whether it’s
trouble or not. What I want is advice.
Maybe you can give it to me, although I
figured Mrs. Dean would be better.”</p>

<p>“Tell me, I may be able to help.” Dean
was surprised at the agitation of the older
man.</p>

<p>Pop told his story. He did not keep any
of the details from Dean. The latter listened,
his astonishment growing all the
time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>“You see, Jack, it’s this way. If they
come here, my wife will see me. She probably
hates me. I cannot hope that she will
understand. On the other hand, I want so
much to be with her, I am going to be foreman
and that means I can support her comfortably.
But I probably would make her
miserable if I entered into her life again.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>“Let us ask Mrs. Dean. She will give
you the right answer.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dean listened. There was no hesitation
in her answer.</p>

<p>“Go to Chicago at once. You need not
worry about how your wife will take it, nor
as to how she feels. I know. She understands
better than you can ever suppose.
Jack, dear, whoever said that God did not
weave our lives? How closely our friends
here have been interwoven with our lives,
how much we have been of service to each
other.</p>

<p>“Go to Chicago on the first train,” she
finished.</p>

<p>“Yes, and we shall tell Ted. Bring them
back with you,” added Dean.</p>

<p>Pop left the house, much relieved. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>
was happy that his duty was what his inclination
was—what he craved to do. He
joined the other men.</p>

<p>Without giving any explanation he told
Smiles he would have to be away for about
ten days and that he had already arranged
for the same with John Dean.</p>

<p>Early the next morning he was off. He
asked Red to take him down. To Red he
explained the whole thing, that he was coming
back with his folks.</p>

<p>“I understand a whole lot of things now.
How queerly you acted at times. I guess
I’ll call you Marsh, now.”</p>

<p>“Yes, and it’s up to you to explain. I
shall wire you before you do so. If my wife
should decide that she does not want me, I
am not coming back. If she decides she will
forgive me, I will telegraph you and you can
let it out casually.”</p>

<p>“I will be glad to do so,” answered Red.
“Is Jack going to tell Ted?”</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s the plan.”</p>

<p>“The boy will be glad. He likes you a lot.
But, mostly glad, because it will make his
mother happy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">[213]</span>“I hope so much that it will,” the older
man answered.</p>

<p>We are not going into details as to the
meeting between the Marshes. We, who are
acquainted with so much of their story, can
imagine what happened. Bill Marsh left
home because he felt he could not hold his
head up nor his wife’s respect. He had
been very foolish, and it was this foolishness,
this false pride, even a lack of faith in
the understanding of his wife that had made
him stay away. Who should have known
him better than his own wife? It was harder
to make Helen understand. She asked some
searching questions, but in the end she realized
the fine manliness of her father.</p>

<p>The two, mother and daughter, marveled
at the coincidence of the father being at the
same place as Ted.</p>

<p>“The world is a small place, isn’t it?”
said Mrs. Marsh.</p>

<p>It did not take very long for them to be
ready to leave. Marsh helped where he
could and a week after he arrived they left
for Big Gulch. Red had paved the way, in
accordance with their plan.</p>

<p>Ted was too surprised to make any comment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
when he heard the news. At first he
was furiously angry at his father. Boylike,
he could not forgive certain things which an
older person could. It was Mrs. Dean, even
more than Red and John Dean, who made
him see and understand.</p>

<p>Then the Marshes came to Big Gulch.
Matters adjusted themselves. It was a busy
time for all. Smiles was off, smiling and
glad. So were the other men who were to
go. Brave men, all of them, doing their duty
as they saw it. Pop took up his duties as
foreman.</p>

<p>Then the child was born to the Deans. A
girl, which seemed like a squalling, ugly
baby, much like any other baby, to Ted. But
to say so to the mother or to the father or to
Mrs. Marsh or to Helen, would have been a
great, an awful insult.</p>

<p>The men came in to see the heir apparent.
They seemed clumsy, uncouth, sheepish
creatures and all of them were glad to get
away, including Pop and Ted.</p>

<p>With the excitement subsiding, things
began again to take a normal aspect. Mrs.
Dean began to sit up, the child began to
look more like a human being, it had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>
been decided that Helen was to rest for a
few months and then continue her studies
at the nearest preparatory school, with the
purpose of entering college. John Dean was
to leave for the front in two weeks.</p>

<p>Our story is almost complete. Ted received
a great welcome at the Academy.
The boys had heard of what he had done, of
his reward and the letter he had received
from Sir Robert Wingate. For one whole
day his coming made the Great War an even
smaller event. Captain Wilson had gone to
Ottawa, he had been promoted to be a major.
Some of the instructors were gone and even
one or two of the older students. Those who
were left spoke only of the time when they,
too, could go and they were bemoaning their
misfortune in being young.</p>

<p>Ted heard from the folks at home. He
heard from Helen and somehow he got the
impression that all she spoke about was
Red and what a fine man he was. A letter
from Red made no mention of Helen, but
he did say that he was getting down to the
serious business of thinking of the future.
Even as young as Ted was, he could guess
that they had become great friends and he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>
was glad. His father wrote him that he had
placed his $1,000.00 in the bank for him, he
having settled all the debts and accounts
himself. It was a fine letter and it removed
what resentment still remained with Ted
against his father. His mother also wrote,
saying she was wonderfully happy and he
got a short note from John Dean before he
left. He also heard from Walker, who told
him he was off for the war, but that Strong
had to stay.</p>

<p>Syd Graham and Ted were inseparable.
They did many things together and the
plans for the future each of the boys made
included the other. There was, of course, a
great deal more of military training and
many times the boys at the Academy were
called upon for some duty or other.</p>

<p>So the days went. Ted received a fall vacation
and he went home. There was news
from the front. Dean had been wounded, so
the report came, not seriously, but enough
to disable him, and he was returning home.
He would always limp. In that awful charge
when so many Canadians had been wounded
and killed, Smiles had lost his life. It made
Ted very sad to think that he would never<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>
see the happy, smiling ex-foreman again.
Helen was at school. Ted pumped Red Mack
as to Helen and found his suspicions confirmed.
He teased Red unmercifully and it
was one time when Red was flustered. The
Dean baby was a healthy, lusty youngster
of a few months.</p>

<p>Lucky, the Boy Scout, as Captain Wilson
called him, has his life before him. This
story is but an incident of his early life. But
for later events, we must look elsewhere.</p>
